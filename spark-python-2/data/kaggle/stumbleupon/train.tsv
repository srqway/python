single can There are 4 grams in a tsp of sugar all carbohydrate so an energy drink sporting 30 grams of rapidly assimilating carbohydrate in liquid form is about 7 8 teaspoons Now let me ask a dumb question How many of you would put 8 teaspoons of sugar into any 10 or 12 oz unsweetened drink Anyway enough of that nonsense As anyone with an ounce of true nutritional sense knows fat is the ultimate source of energy both dietary and body fat It s simple A gram of carbohydrate like sugar or HFCS has 4 kilocalories of energy while a gram of fat has 9 more than twice as much gram for gram But there s one kind of fat that s a bit special medium chain triglyceride MCT What s special about it MCTs passively diffuse from the GI tract to the portal system longer fatty acids are absorbed into the lymphatic system without requirement for modification like long chain fatty acids or very long chain fatty acids In addition MCTs do not require bile salts for digestion Patients that have malnutrition or malabsorption syndromes are treated with MCTs because they do not require energy for absorption utilization or storage Coconut oil is composed of approximately 66 medium chain triglycerides Other rich sources of MCTs include palm kernel oils and camphor tree drupes The fatty acids found in MCTs are called medium chain fatty acids You usually have to dig a bit if you don t already know to discover that these MCTs are SATURATED FATS Or should I say arterycloggingsaturatedfat Another thing to note is that they digest rapidly like sugar in a drink and so are truly in the category of supplying rapid energy the whole point of an energy drink or glucose gel such as endurance athletes use But guess what Little to no glycemic load They don t spike your blood sugar to significant degree and thus don t spike your insulin significantly leaving you to later need another energy drink and another and another Peak valley peak valley wash rinse repeat There s more Turns out that MCTs have other huge benefits in terms of blood sugar control in diabetics as well as actual fat loss Yea a fat that makes you lose body fat Let s take a look at what the scientistas have to say Pubmed Greater rise in fat oxidation with medium chain triglyceride consumption relative to long chain triglyceride is associated with lower initial body weight and greater loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue CONCLUSION These data suggest that shunting of dietary fat towards oxidation results in diminished fat storage as reflected by the loss of BW and subcutaneous adipose tissue Furthermore MCT consumption may stimulate EE and fat oxidation to a lower extent in men of greater BW compared to men of lower BW indicative of the lower responsiveness to a rapidly oxidized fat by overweight men This was a randomized crossover controlled feeding trail Subjects got either high amounts of MCT or LCT olive oil Crossover means that each group was subjected to both diets which is gold standard Those on MCT lost almost twice as much fat as those on LCT ScienceDirect Medium chain triglycerides Abstract chemical and physical properties of MCFAs show substantial metabolic differences MCFAs do not require binding to proteins such as fatty acid binding protein fatty acid transport protein and or fatty acid translocase FAT homolog to human platelet CD36 MCFAs are a preferred source of energy \u03b2 oxidation MCFAs are also incorporated into adipose tissue triglycerides and may influence adipose tissue and other systemic functions more substantially than previously assumed MCTs reduce fat mass through down regulation of adipogenic genes as well as peroxisome proliferator activated receptor \u03b3 Recent studies confirmed the potential of MCFAs to reduce body weight and particularly body fat This effect was not transient MCFAs reduce lipoprotein secretion and attenuate postprandial triglyceride response It was however frequently observed that MCTs increase fasting cholesterol and triglyceride levels But given in moderate amounts in diets with moderate fat supply MCFAs may actually reduce fasting lipid levels more than oils rich in mono or polyunsaturated fatty acids The same is true for glucose levels MCTs improved several features contributing to enhanced insulin sensitivity Under certain in vitro conditions MCTs exert proinflammatory effects but in vivo MCTs may reduce intestinal injury and protect from hepatotoxicity This is just a review article looking at studies demonstrating a lot of the benefits of MCTs that we re talking about Do note the warning siren about elevated fasting cholesterol and triglycerides Of course this is just the abstract such that some news media regurgitator in the Health section can write a dumbshit headline like Coconut Milk Raises Cholesterol Levels Study Finds Then you tear into the full text and find it wasn t significant it was one poorly controlled study out of many or some other BS And who cares about cholesterol numbers anyway Cool that it may also may aid intestinal repair and protect your liver from drug or alcohol induced toxicity important for those on medications or who drink regularly More Hell I don t do science that often anymore so let s go all out But in consideration of the environment let s save some space and you can click over to the abstracts you want to read PubMed Physiological effects of medium chain triglycerides potential agents in the prevention of obesity PubMed Medium chain fatty acid metabolism and energy expenditure obesity treatment implications PubMed Medium chain fatty acids as metabolic therapy in cardiac disease the heart muscle loves ketone bodies I ve heard Ed PubMed Medium chain fatty acids functional lipids for the prevention and treatment of the metabolic syndrome Well here s one from 1986 that bears quoting the entire abstract especially in view of the recipe for my secret energy drink below PubMed Medium chain triglycerides MCT in aging and arteriosclerosis Abstract Some of the nutritional work with triglycerides consisting mainly of C8 and C10 fatty acids MCT lends itself to speculations about their influence on arteriosclerosis Arteriosclerosis is thought to be part of the normal aging process which is due to age associated molecular biological changes The lipid theory of arteriosclerosis is rejected Pertinent studies with MCT include these observations Feeding of MCT to rats resulted in animals of low body weight small fat deposits and excellent survival rate This deserves emphasis because of the beneficial influence of low body weight on aging and arteriosclerosis MCT feeding was associated with low linoleate and low tocopherol requirements in rats This may lead to reduced formation of those linoleate derived prostaglandins which favor thrombosis formation Lower linoleate requirements may also lead to the presence of fewer uncontrolled free radicals in the cells MCT feeding is associated with low levels of serum and liver cholesterol involving speculations that tissue conditions are such that an adaptive increase of cholesterol is unnecessary The Demographic Yearbook of the United Nations 1978 reported that Sri Lanka has the lowest death rate from ischemic heart disease Sri Lanka is the only of the countries giving reliable data where coconut oil containing over 50 medium chain fatty acids is the main dietary fat emphasis added So while it doesn t say how much saturated fat the lowest death rate from heart disease Sri Lankans ate we do have an idea for another population the Tokelauans who eat about 50 of energy from saturated fat and have no evidence of heart disease I blogged about it way back here There was one other issue I wanted to cover and that s the potential insulin stimulating effects of MCTs if any and whether coconut milk with 1 gram of carbohydrate per ounce could present any problem to diabetics I dug all over the place got lots of help from Twitter peeps thanks much all of you but in the end could not really come to firm conclusions so I ll leave that to comments Other than that there s this interesting conversation between Marty Gallagher and Dr Chris Hardy at PrecisionNutrition on MCTs coconut oil and coconut milk in both a health and training context Good stuff Alright now while I certainly didn t need to do all this sciency researchin to know that a natural product like coconut milk would be like most wholesome food good for me I want to make sure you have confidence dear reader that indeed it is safe to go back in the water The sharks are all over at Jamba Juice getting their faux health smoothies count how many of those sugar drinks have over 100g of sugar Nope what you ll get here is a smoothie an energy drink that will blow the lid off all that crap in a cup in terms of sustained level energy and satiation and well you ve seen the potential numerous health and weight loss and control benefits Incidentally coconut fat is about 90 saturated Of the saturated fat 66 is comprised of MCTs And by the way I ve used both coconut oil and coconut milk in cooking for years particularly for Thai curries Also last year at NovNat over a week we probably each had near or more than a can of coconut milk every morning see the top pic and I for one was rarely ever hungry much for lunch in spite of the activity though I ate big every meal And I lost 3 pounds over the week and felt great Alright the recipe 1 cup full fat coconut milk I like Native Forrest 1 4 cup water 2 raw egg yolks don t eat whites raw cook them to destroy avidin an

Management "",""body"":""Summer seems to finally be here June in New England was literally a washout but the sun came out for the Fourth of July holiday While it hasn t exactly been beach weather lately it hopefully will be very soon This means of course that a person needs to have a beach ready body right Most of us know that losing weight and staying fit and managing diabetes requires a certain measure of discipline to choose the right foods in the right amounts and to stay active on a fairly regular basis But it s hard and temptations sometimes get in the way of good intentions When s that magic pill coming It may not be here yet but what about all those fat burning foods we hear and read about Is there something to them Let s find out VinegarVinegar is acidic so it can be irritating to the mouth throat and stomach if ingested in too high a quantity But it has its benefits Vinegar is thought to help slow the rise in blood glucose after a meal essentially lowering the glycemic index of a meal and it may also help with blood pressure control It used to be one of those old wives tales swallow a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar before your meals and you ll rev up your metabolism Vinegar supposedly helps curb appetite and cut cravings But until lately there was no credible research proving any of this However Japanese scientists have found that there may actually be something to vinegar and weight loss The researchers gave two groups of mice white vinegar in various concentrations via a stomach tube and gave another group of mice water Both groups were fed a high fat diet The vinegar fed mice had 10 less body fat than the water fed mice Vinegar contains acetic acid which may turn on genes that signal the body to break down fat preventing it from accumulating in body tissue Should you take vinegar for weight loss It s hard to say It s certainly fine to use vinegar as a marinade or in salad dressings If you decide to try it before meals dilute it with some water to reduce possible irritation Spicy FoodsDo you love hot spicy dishes Is Tabasco sauce one of your must have condiments If so you may be in luck with regard to your metabolism that is Some studies show that eating foods seasoned with chili pepper or black pepper can boost metabolism by up to 23 When you eat a spicy dish your body generates more heat which in turn helps burn calories But unless you eat spicy foods constantly and maybe you do the amount of calories that you actually burn may be negligible And the effect on metabolism only lasts for about 30 minutes However spicy foods may offer another benefit making you feel more full In fact in one study men who were fed appetizers seasoned with hot sauce before eating a meal ate about 200 fewer calories than men who didn t eat the hot sauce The researchers think that the sauce which contained capsaicin the chemical that makes certain peppers hot helped to blunt their appetites So spice up your meals with some red pepper flakes hot sauce or even ginger But be careful if you have heartburn as these spices may aggravate the condition Green TeaGreen tea has received a lot of press over the past few years particularly in the realm of helping to fight heart disease and some types of cancer Green tea is rich in certain polyphenols types of antioxidants called catechins that have anti inflammatory and anticancer properties But green tea may do more than fight disease Some evidence shows that drinking green tea may also help with weight loss In one study Japanese men were given oolong tea infused with green tea extract A control group drank oolong tea without green tea extract After three months those who drank the green tea extract lost an average of 5 3 pounds while those who didn t drink the extract lost only 2 9 pounds And in research looking at mice prone to obesity those who ate food containing green tea extract gained less weight and body fat It may be that the catechins in the green tea increase thermogenesis or the burning of calories as body heat At any rate if you re thinking of trying green tea to help with your weight be prepared to drink between 4 to 7 cups of it each day EggsOK eggs don t have magical fat burning properties although to be honest not many foods actually do But a study published last year in the International Journal of Obesity showed that men and women who ate two eggs for breakfast as part of a lower calorie diet lost 65 more weight and had a 34 greater reduction in their waist circumference than men and women who ate a bagel for breakfast The secret Eggs very likely increased satiety a feeling of fullness so that folks ended up eating less I ve mentioned eggs in previous postings they can be part of pretty much anyone s eating plan So maybe there aren t any foods that will melt away the fat But the foods I ve mentioned above can certainly be part of an eating plan geared to help you lose and maintain a

mind and body from an eclectic mix of knowledge personal experience pop culture tall tales of long nights the latest studies to make the health news wires and second hand tips You might have gathered that alcohol is a depressant that it s dehydrating that you can drink about one drink an hour and stay relatively sober Some of that is true But much of it depends on a large number of factors Let s dig into some of the things we do and don t know about alcohol Relevant sources are linked where cited but much of the background material comes from Buzz The Science and Lore of Alcohol and Caffeine new ish Kindle edition linked there It s a science based tome written in a clear language by Stephen Braun and was the main reference for our take on caffeine We re taking a few things for granted here that you understand some of the basics of alcohol consumption blood alcohol content legal limits what it feels like when you ve had too much to drink and the serious illness of alcoholism We re not trying to help you get loaded quicker or drink more for longer periods We re digging into some of the science behind how you and alcohol interact It Works Differently on Full Stomachs Young Women Some Asians and Aspirin Takers Your body sees alcohol as a poison or at least as something it doesn t actually want inside it To fight back and sober you up humans produce an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase That enzyme gets its shot at your alcohol when it attempts to pass through the stomach lining and when it reaches your liver primarily On contact it snatches a hydrogen atom off the ethanol molecules in your drink rendering it into non intoxicating acetaldehyde Humans can then use aldehyde dehydrogenase as a kind of clean up crew breaking down the acetaldehyde that s sometimes considered a cause of hangovers along with dehydration For more on the myths versus reality of hangovers see our guide to hangover cures Image via Wikimedia Commons Seems pretty simple no It s a fight between how much you can drink versus how fast your enzymes can bust down your indulgences and their byproducts But many factors affect certain people s production of the two alcohol crushing compounds Alcohol dehydrogenase AD is for reasons not wholly understood more effective in men than in women Young men in fact may have up to 70 to 80 percent greater enzyme activity in the presence of alcohol But men s AD effectiveness also drops off with age at a faster rate than in women such that by around 55 or 60 men may find themselves able to handle less alcohol than their female counterparts all other factors being equal A full stomach helps break down alcohol but not because your food soaks up the alcohol When you eat a big meal your stomach s pyloric sphincter a kind of release valve into the small intestine closes tightly Your body knows that you ve got food that should get a good going over in your stomach before it heads straight to the high absorption small intestine so it keeps it there and the AD in your stomach has more time to work on the alcohol Drink on an empty stomach and the liquid quickly makes it into the small intestine where there s more than 200 square meters of surface area for absorption into your body Image via peretzpup Another big factor in alcohol absorption and alcohol s effects is genetics Your great great grandparents have a say in how buzzed your Friday night gets for sure but for roughly one third to half of Asian drinkers it s more than a slight variance Alcohol flush reaction a flushing of the face when drinking occurs because the enzyme clean up crew aldehyde dehydrogenase is mutated by just one amino acid That changes how effective its molecules are in bonding with and busting up acetaldehyde With excess acetaldehyde in their system those with a flush reaction get red faced and can experience heart palpitations dizziness and severe nausea in extreme cases Your own genetic makeup of AD and aldehyde dehydrogenase affect your ability to break down alcohol and its byproducts in similar fashion Don t take aspirin before drinking unless you love hangovers Aspirin seriously cuts the effectiveness of your body s AD enzymes In one 1990 study the average blood alcohol levels of those who took two maximum strength aspirin tablets before drinking were an average of 26 percent higher than those who were aspirin free Other studies have suggested even more impact on your body s ability to break down alcohol That also means more acetaldehyde in your system down the line so you ll learn your lesson quickly if you re considering aspirin as a helper Side Note Absorption and Elimination Is a Curve Not a Straight Line Think you ve got a handle on the basic one drink per hour algorithm for your weekend nights Check out this explainer from a forensic toxicology lab which also links up an advanced Blood Alcohol Calculator Your BAC moves through plateaus responds differently to drinks higher than 20 25 percent alcohol by volume and eliminates some alcohol in pure form which is how police can measure it on your breath It Extends Your Life Kind Of Every few weeks it seems a new study suggests a glass of wine or sometimes any old drink lengthens your life if you don t overdo it Plucking just one out of the pile you ll see that in Alcoholism Clinical and Experimental Research researchers followed 1824 people over a total of 20 years as they aged between 55 and 65 Of those who abstained entirely 69 percent died Among those who drank in moderate amounts 41 percent died which was 23 percent less than the light drinkers Even heavy drinkers fared better than abstainers with just 61 percent passing away during the study period How could a substance that everybody and their five brothers tell you to go easy on extend your life Popular theories center on the antioxidants and resveratrol compounds found in wines or on the studies showing alcohol as increasing levels of HDL good cholesterol But Jonah Lehrer at Wired points out the not so obvious the link between a longer life and alcohol may not be direct but it s likely very real It relates to the long term benefits of reducing stress as well as alcohol s role in facilitating get togethers and acting as a social lubricant What does this have to do with longevity In recent years sociologists and epidemiologists have begun studying the long term effects Direct PDF link of loneliness It turns out to be really dangerous We are social primates and when we re cut off from the social network we are more likely to die from just about everything but especially heart disease At this point the link between abstinence and social isolation is merely hypothetical But given the extensive history of group drinking it s what we do when we come together it seems likely that drinking in moderation makes it easier for us develop and nurture relationships And it s these relationships that help keep us alive Image via LINXBAS Theoretically then you might get some of the same benefits if you were a savvy social Diet Coke drinker But it s likely a combination of actual alcohol effects along with their social expressions that leads to study after study showing drinkers as getting some kind of life extending benefit It Doesn t Kill Brain Cells but Does Inhibit Them It s true that at high concentrations like the nearly 100 percent pure alcohol used in sterilizing solutions alcohol can indeed kill cells and neurons and nearly anything else But given that the blood reaching your brain is only at 0 08 percent alcohol if you re legally intoxicated or say 0 25 percent if you ve just closed a major deal in Tokyo it s not doing a lot of damage to your actual brain cells liver cells and other organs with long term chronic abuse are another matter Don t believe it A major study by Grethe Jensen and colleagues in 1993 matched brain samples taken from both alcoholics and nonalcoholics from groups of the two dead from non alcohol related causes There were no significant differences found in either the number or density of brain cells between the groups Misconception Junction tackles Jensen s study and the topic in more depth What alcohol can and does do to your brain is affect the way your neurons get their firing triggers from glutamate It infiltrates the glutamate receptors in your synapses hurting their ability to send off their normal fire messages Alcohol has this impact all across your brain the parts that control muscles speech coordination judgment and so on Keep that in mind the next time you or someone else claims that they drive golf or otherwise perform some task better with alcohol s help As Stephen Braun puts it in Buzz The Science and Lore of Alcohol and Caffeine Substances such as cocaine and LSD work like pharmacological scalpels altering the functioning of only one or a handful of brain circuits Alcohol is more like a pharmacological hand grenade It affects practically everything around it Side Note That s Also Why It Uh Inhibits Sex The studies and implications are numerous to say the least but if you want a thumbnail understanding of how alcohol as Shakespeare put it provokes the desire but takes away the performance it has to do with the firing of nerves in the brain and elsewhere that would relax the arteries enough to get both parties moving It s a bit more complex than that and drinking in moderation can be a net benefit in some cases but alcohol paradoxically doesn t help one specific region of your self to relax Side Note 2 Alcohol is Particularly Effective at Inhibiting Memories Like the sexual response the way the brain makes memories is far from comprehensively understood But it does seem linked to N Methyl D aspartic acid or NMDA the receptor for which alcohol seems particularly adept at interfering with according to Braun Studies have shown that while subjects under alcohol s influence can recall existing memories events happening during inebriation are regularly hard to remember It varies with the amount consumed and seems to top out at a serious 0 2 percent blood alcohol content but anything from flimsy recall to full on blackouts are possible due to alcohol s unique bond with the stuff that should make memories It Makes Other People Seem More Intentional If you d never been raised to think things through you d assume that most actions people took were fairly intentional and possibly pointed at causing you harm The same holds when people are asked to make snap judgments about things happening But give yourself any amount of time and you ll generally think out all the reasons something could have happened avoiding your natural intentionality bias and preventing heated arguments with otherwise close friends bar altercations and 80 percent of all reality show plots Image via terren in Virginia But as you might have guessed that reasoned thinking gets lost when there s a night s worth of alcohol moving through your brain In the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin researchers detail a study with 92 men made to go three hours without food then given a shot of either juice or juice with more than a shot of pure alcohol All the glasses were rimmed with alcohol to mask the placebos The men thought they took part in a taste test then did unrelated tasks for 30 minutes After that they were asked to determine whether a series of deliberate accidental or vague stated actions He deleted the email She looked for her keys She tripped on the jump rope etc were deliberate or accidental Ars Technica sums up the results Nearly all the participants no matter what condition judged all the unambiguous statements correctly However when the actions were ambiguous and could have been performed either intentionally or unintentionally the drunk participants were much more likely to perceive the actions as deliberate than the sober participants were The study showed that it didn t much matter whether a man thought he was drunk the jump to conclusions about an intention only took place when someone actually did have too much in them It s a Terrible Sleep Aid Ever heard the term nightcap People have long believed that alcohol helps you get to sleep and that part can be true for some Once you re asleep though alcohol s interaction with your brain can lead to some fitful sleep and no sleep at all especially if you consumed caffeine anytime close to hitting the pillow Image via Ella s Dad Just as with caffeine your brain proves remarkably adept at adapting itself and responding to the ethanol molecules jamming up its receptors and interfering with neuron firings It takes a bit for the brain to catch up though and when your brain starts kicking in and reclaiming all its nooks and crannies it can wreak havoc on your crucial REM sleep along with your more passive general resting If you ve had caffeine too it s a drug that can take up to 5 hours to break down half a dose If it s in your system at the same time as your brain is trying to compensate for alcohol the combined revenge of both drugs can lead to some fairly restless sleep according to Braun s

peel This tart has a soft smooth and tangy lemon filling which is similar in texture to a baked custard We like the filling to be quite tangy but if you would prefer a milder flavour the tart will still turn out well if the amount of lemon juice in the filling is reduced to 125ml 1 2 cup The filling is partially cooked on the stovetop before being oven baked in a precooked pastry case The buttery pastry can be difficult to work with If you don t wish to roll the pastry out or if it breaks when you are lifting it into the pan you can use your fingers to press the dough evenly over the base and up the side of the tart pan If desired the pastry case can be baked the day before filling and stored in an airtight container at room temperature Serves about 9 10 We use a 20ml tablespoon and 250ml measuring cup for all of our recipes Pastry162g 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon plain flour38g 1 4 cup self raising flour60g 1 3 cup firmly packed pure icing sugar sifted100g cold butter chopped into about 15 pieces1 large egg yolk we use eggs with a minimum weight of 59g Lemon Filling4 large eggs we use eggs with a minimum weight of 59g 40g 2 tablespoons plus 1 2 teaspoon butter chopped into a few pieces166ml 2 3 cup cream 35 to 40 percent fat 166ml 2 3 cup fresh lemon juice200g 3 4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugarPastryPlace plain flour self raising flour and icing sugar in a food processor and process on medium speed for about 20 seconds to combine the ingredients Add the cold butter to the flour mixture Process on medium speed for about 15 seconds until only tiny lumps of butter remain any butter pieces should be smaller than a grain of rice Add the egg yolk to the processor and process on medium speed until the yolk is incorporated and the mixture just starts to clump together about 30 60 seconds During processing you may need to stop the machine and run a spatula around the side at the base of the bowl to dislodge any unincorporated ingredients Remove the processor blade and use your hand to press the dough clumps together into a mass Tip the dough onto a large sheet of baking paper the paper can be reused when rolling out the pastry Use your hands to bring the pastry together into a smooth ball Form the pastry into a disc shape Wrap pastry disc with plastic wrap or place in a freezer bag and refrigerate for two to three hours After at least two hours resting time remove the pastry from the refrigerator and leave it at room temperature for 10 30 minutes until just soft enough to roll out the time required will depend on the temperature of the room Adjust the oven rack to the lowest shelf position the pastry base will brown and crisp better if it is close to the bottom element If possible set your oven so that the top and bottom elements are on and the fan if present is off Then preheat oven to 180 degrees Celsius If you have a fan forced oven and aren t able to turn the fan off preheat your oven to 160 degrees Celsius Place unwrapped pastry disc between two large sheets of baking paper Using a rolling pin roll pastry out to form a 29cm diameter circle The pastry circle should be just large enough to line the pan if you make the circle much larger the pastry will be too thin When rolling the pastry out you may find that the edges of the pastry start to develop large cracks as in the photo below If this happens use your fingers to press the pastry back together to repair the cracks The bottom sheet of baking paper may develop creases during rolling These creases can make deep cuts in the pastry To help prevent this we do the following once or twice during rolling 1 Leave the pastry between the two sheets of baking paper Flip the paper and pastry over so the bottom sheet of baking paper is now on the top 2 Lift the top sheet of baking paper off the pastry to remove the creases and then place the paper down again and continue rolling Ensure the pastry shape is as round as possible If it isn t round the pastry may not completely line the pan Once the pastry is rolled out to the desired size we briefly place it in the freezer to make it easier to work with and help prevent it from breaking when transferring to the pan We leave the pastry between the sheets of baking paper place it flat on a large tray board and put it in the freezer for 2 3 minutes to firm up exclusivelyfood com auWhen you are ready to transfer the pastry to the pan loosen the top sheet of baking paper by lifting it off the pastry and then placing it back down Keeping the pastry between the two sheets of baking paper flip the paper and pastry over so the bottom sheet of paper is now on the top Remove the top sheet of baking paper This process of loosening the paper makes it easier to lift the pastry off the baking paper when transferring the pastry to the pan You will need a 3cm deep 23cm base diameter loose bottomed tart pan If you have experience lining tart pans with pastry you can ignore the next paragraph The following instructions for lifting the pastry into the pan would probably suit left handed people so use the opposite sides hands if you prefer Place the pan to the right of the pastry round With your left hand hold the rolling pin above the pastry Work quickly to help prevent the pastry from breaking Use the baking paper to lift the right side of the pastry up and drape it over the rolling pin Leave the pastry resting on the rolling pin and return the baking paper in your hand to the bench Slide your right hand between the pastry and baking paper still resting on the bench Lift the pastry with your right hand and move the pastry to the left side of the tart pan When the pastry is in the correct position slide your right hand to the right using it to support the pastry as you roll it off the rolling pin and into the pan Ease the pastry into the pan Fold down any pastry that extends above the top rim of the pan and press it onto the edge crust to reinforce Trim the edges of the pastry to neaten Place pastry in freezer for 15 minutes Scrunch one of the sheets of baking paper that you used when rolling the pastry until the paper is soft and pliable Flatten the sheet of baking paper and use it to line the pastry case Then half fill the case with raw rice dried beans or pie weights and gently push the rice weights up against the side of the case to support the edge crust Place pan on the lowest oven rack and bake pastry for 25 minutes Remove pastry from oven and carefully lift the baking paper and rice weights out of the pastry case Return the pastry to the lowest oven rack and bake for about 10 minutes until a light golden colour Place pan on a wire rack and allow pastry to cool for at least 30 minutes before starting filling FillingWhen ready to start the filling preheat oven to 160 degrees Celsius 140 degrees Celsius fan forced You will need a double boiler or a medium large saucepan and a large heatproof bowl that is wider than the saucepan One quarter fill the saucepan with water Sit the bowl on top of the saucepan and check that the base of the bowl doesn t touch the water use a different bowl if necessary Remove the bowl and bring the saucepan of water to the simmer Place eggs in the bowl and lightly whisk with a fork or whisk to combine but not aerate Add butter cream lemon juice and sugar to the bowl and use a heatproof spatula to stir to combine the butter won t combine with the other ingredients at this stage Sit the bowl on top of the saucepan and stir the mixture constantly with the spatula scraping the base and side of the bowl to prevent the mixture sticking to the bowl and overcooking You may need to adjust the heat to keep the water at a simmer don t allow the water to boil Continue stirring the mixture until it thickens slightly and a thin layer clings to the spatula about 15 20 minutes If you draw your finger across the spatula a clear trail should remain in the filling clinging to the spatula You will probably notice small white pieces of egg in the filling one such piece is shown on the spatula below Strain the filling into the pastry case to remove the lumps of egg Smooth the surface of the filling with the spatula or the back of a spoon Baking Serving and StorageBake for about 18 20 minutes on the lowest oven rack The tart filling should be set around the edges and the centre should be slightly wobbly when the tart is gently shaken Place tart on a wire rack to cool completely The tart can be served at room temperature or refrigerated until cold Serve with whipped cream or ice cream if desired The tart is best eaten on the day of making as the filling will soften the pastry over time Store tart in an airtight container in the refrigerator Not suitable to freeze www

in depth fully referenced information on medicines vitamins herbs and dietary and lifestyle changes that may be helpful About acne vulgaris Acne vulgaris also known as common acne is an inflammatory condition of the sebaceous glands of the skin It consists of red elevated areas on the skin that may develop into pustules and even further into cysts that can cause scarring Acne vulgaris occurs mostly on the face neck and back of most commonly teenagers and to a lesser extent of young adults The condition results in part from excessive stimulation of the skin by androgens male hormones Bacterial infection of the skin also appears to play a role Product ratings for acne vulgaris Science Ratings Nutritional Supplements Herbs Niacinamide topical Zinc Tea tree oil topical Guggul Pantothenic acid Vitamin A Vitamin B6 Burdock Vitex associated with menstrual cycle See also Homeopathic Remedies for Acne What are the symptoms Acne is a skin condition characterized by pimples which may be closed sometimes called pustules or whiteheads or open blackheads on the face neck chest back and shoulders Most acne is mild although some people experience inflammation with larger cysts which may result in scarring Dietary changes that may be helpful Many people assume certain aspects of diet are linked to acne but there is not much evidence to support this idea Preliminary research found for example that chocolate was not implicated 1 Similarly though a diet high in iodine can create an acne like rash in a few people this is rarely the cause of acne In a preliminary study foods that patients believed triggered their acne failed to cause problems when tested in a clinical setting 2 Some doctors of natural medicine have observed that food allergy plays a role in some cases of acne particularly adult acne 3 However that observation has not been supported by scientific studies Vitamins that may be helpful In a double blind trial topical application of a 4 niacinamide gel twice daily for two months resulted in significant in improvement in people with acne 4 However there is little reason to believe this vitamin would have similar actions if taken orally Several double blind trials indicate that zinc supplements reduce the severity of acne 567 8 In one double blind trial 9 though not in another 10 zinc was found to be as effective as oral antibiotic therapy Doctors sometimes suggest that people with acne take 30 mg of zinc two or three times per day for a few months then 30 mg per day thereafter It often takes 12 weeks before any improvement is seen Long term zinc supplementation requires 1 2 mg of copper per day to prevent copper deficiency Large quantities of vitamin A such as 300 000 IU per day for females and 400 000 500 000 IU per day for males have been used successfully to treat severe acne 11 However unlike the long lasting benefits of the synthetic prescription version of vitamin A isotretinoin as Accutane the acne typically returns several months after natural vitamin A is discontinued In addition the large amounts of vitamin A needed to control acne can be toxic and should be used only under careful medical supervision In a preliminary trial people with acne were given 2 5 grams of pantothenic acid orally four times per day for a total of 10 grams per day a remarkably high amount 12 A cream containing 20 pantothenic acid was also applied topically four to six times per day With moderate acne near complete relief was seen within two months while severe conditions took at least six months to respond Eventually the intake of pantothenic acid was reduced to 1 to 5 grams per day still a very high amount A preliminary report suggested that vitamin B6 at 50 mg per day may alleviate premenstrual flare ups of acne experienced by some women 13 While no controlled research has evaluated this possibility an older controlled trial of resistant adolescent acne found that 50 250 mg per day decreased skin oiliness and improved acne in 75 of the participants 14 However another preliminary report suggested that vitamin B6 supplements might exacerbate acne vulgaris 15 Are there any side effects or interactions Refer to the individual supplement for information about any side effects or interactions Herbs that may be helpful A clinical trial compared the topical use of 5 tea tree oil to 5 benzoyl peroxide for common acne Although the tea tree oil was slower and less potent in its action it had far fewer side effects and was thus considered more effective overall 16 One controlled trial found that guggul Commiphora mukul compared favorably to tetracycline in the treatment of cystic acne 17 The amount of guggul extract taken in the trial was 500 mg twice per day Historically tonic herbs such as burdock have been used in the treatment of skin conditions These herbs are believed to have a cleansing action when taken internally 18 Burdock root tincture may be taken in the amount of 2 to 4 ml per day Dried root preparations in a capsule or tablet can be used at 1 to 2 grams three times per day Many herbal preparations combine burdock root with other alterative herbs such as yellow dock red clover or cleavers In the treatment of acne none of these herbs has been studied in scientific research Some older preliminary German research suggests that vitex might contribute to clearing of premenstrual acne possibly by regulating hormonal influences on acne 19 Women in these studies used 40 drops of a concentrated liquid product once daily 20 Are there any side effects or interactions Refer to the individual herb for information about any side effects or interactions Holistic approaches that may be helpful Acupuncture may be helpful in the treatment of acne Several preliminary studies have reported that a series of acupuncture treatments 8 to 15 is markedly effective or curative in 90 to 98 of patients 212223 Besides traditional Chinese acupuncture using needles alone a technique called cupping is frequently used in the treatment of acne Cupping refers to the use of cup shaped instruments to apply suction to the area being needled Two preliminary trials of cupping treatment for acne reported marked improvement in 91 to 96 of the study participants 2425 Controlled trials are necessary to determine the true efficacy of acupuncture and other traditional Chinese therapies in the treatment of acne Some hypnotherapists believe that hypnosis might help prevent facial scarring associated with acne In one case study a patient was instructed to say the word scar in place of picking her face and the scratch marks resolved The underlying acne was unaffected 26 References To view roll mouse over the References heading to hide click on the heading 1 Fulton JE Jr Plewig G Kligman AM

Woman in the World by Richard Rhodes Hardcover 261 pages purchase close Purchase Featured Books Hedy s Folly The Life and Breakthrough Inventions of Hedy Lamarr the Most Beautiful Woman in the World Richard Rhodes At the height of her Hollywood career actress Hedy Lamarr was known as the most beautiful woman in the world For most of her life her legacy was her looks But in the 1940s in an attempt to help the war effort she quietly invented what would become the precursor to many wireless technologies we use today including Bluetooth GPS cellphone networks and more An Unlikely Beginning A new book by Pulitzer Prize winning author Richard Rhodes sets out to rewrite America s memory of Lamarr Hedy s Folly The Life and Breakthrough Inventions of Hedy Lamarr The Most Beautiful Woman in the World chronicles her life and the inventive side that is not often mentioned Rhodes tells Rachel Martin guest host of weekends on All Things Considered that Lamarr had been fascinated with science as a child growing up in Austria but pursued acting instead Her first break into Hollywood came when she heard Louis Mayer of Metro Goldwyn Mayer studios was scouting for actors She went to see him in London He wasn t willing to offer her a very good deal so she said no and walked out having great confidence in herself Rhodes says When Lamarr found out Mayer was headed back to the United States she bought a ticket for the same boat Once she was aboard she found a way to make him long for her after all she was an actress And before the ship landed in New York she had a much much better contract the equivalent of about 3 000 a week for seven years he says Within a year with the appearance of her in the film Algiers opposite Charles Boyer she was a superstar Un Hollywood Rhodes says Lamarr was most often cast based on her looks and had few lines She quickly grew bored in Hollywood Hedy didn t drink She didn t like to party he says Her idea of a good evening was a quiet dinner party with some intelligent friends where they could discuss ideas which sounds so un Hollywood but Hedy had to find something else to do to occupy her time Rhodes says she had a drafting table installed in her house and started inventing Among her projects was an improved stoplight and a tablet that when dissolved in water created a soda similar to Coca Cola She laughed later and said Well it never really worked It probably tasted like an Alka Seltzer tablet which is basically what it was he laughs But she was constantly looking at the world and thinking Well how could that be fixed How could that be improved Enlarge Random House Richard Rhodes is a journalist a historian and the author of more than 20 fiction and nonfiction books Random House Richard Rhodes is a journalist a historian and the author of more than 20 fiction and nonfiction books Inspired By War As she was inventing Rhodes says Lamarr was simultaneously glued to the events of World War II When German submarines began targeting passenger cruise liners he says she felt compelled to invent something to help the Allied cause She zeroed in on torpedoes which were powerful weapons but hard to control Rhodes says she thought that if they could be radio guided there was a better chance they would hit their target She understood that the problem with radio signals was that they could be jammed But if you could make the signal hop around more or less randomly from radio frequency to radio frequency then the person at the other end trying to jam the signal won t know where it is he says If they try to jam one particular frequency it might hit that frequency on one of its hops but it would only be there for a fraction of a second Thus her take on spread spectrum radio was born Lamarr and her co inventor composer George Antheil submitted their idea to the National Inventor s Council and received a patent for their Secret Communication System in 1942 They were anxious to share their invention with the Navy but got a lackluster response The Navy being the Navy if it hadn t been able to make a torpedo that worked obviously it wasn t going to be receptive to ideas coming in from outside Rhodes says The Navy basically threw it into the file Untouched For Years The Navy classified the patent as top secret and it remained untouched for years But after World War II the Navy was interested in developing a so called sonobuoy that would use sonar to detect submarines in the water and transmit the information to an airplane above However it needed a way to jam proof the signal between the buoy and the plane They resuscitated the idea of frequency hopping and built it into the sonobuoy And after that the whole system just spread like wildfire Rhodes says The military and private companies all started developing their own technologies around Lamarr s invention Today vestiges of her frequency hopping technique are found in most digital devices that communicate wirelessly But Rhodes says Lamarr s contribution was lost in the noise for decades In the 1990s when she was in her early 80s one of the pioneers of wireless communications for computers came across Lamarr s patent and realized she d never been honored He started the ball rolling so that one of the major communications organizations would give her one of its awards She by then had had so much bad plastic surgery that she didn t like to go out in public so she received the award by telephone he says When they called her up to tell her she would get the award her first words were Hedy Lamarr being Hedy Lamarr

inspiration from When I m cooking or baking I ll usually browse through a number of cookbooks or call my Mom and ask for a recipe Sometimes I ll search the web for great ideas or check out other blogs Honestly I ve never looked to an iconic chocolate for inspiration That is until a day or two ago I was fortunate enough to be invited as a guest of Ellie to the launch of Ferrero s Festival of Light which was held infront of the Customs House in Sydney The event was hosted by Charlotte Dawson and was officially launched by Rocco Perna from Ferrero Australia What a great way to kick start the Christmas season than with a spectacular light show Drawing inspiration from Ellie s beautiful Ferrero macarons I decided to make a Ferrero Tart and Verrine both desserts are perfect when you are looking for that additional extra to entertain during the holiday season and are made from the same components just served differently In true Ferrero form this dessert is made with a chocolate tart

Main Courses Pasta Chick Food Alert This one s for the ladies gentlemen I say that because well there s no meat in it And I know there are some of you Renaissance Men out there who are not above eating a dinner wholly devoid of animal flesh but I sure don t know any of you So for my life this dish is poised right at the top of my list of Chick Foods which means I won t make it unless Marlboro Man is in China for the week It s Pasta Primavera which translates to Spring Pasta in English and the classic dish uses a mixture of bright green vegetables mixed with pasta As I sit typing this post in 97 degree weather I m well aware that it s no longer spring And really since many of the vegetables used in my recipe don t become ripe in my garden until at least the middle of July Spring Pasta really isn t a fitting name at all Is there a Pasta Naming Coalition who can hear my complaint Is there a form I can fill out It s just that I believe calling it Pasta Primavera is really dishonest So is my suggestion that any of these vegetables came from my garden because they didn t But enough of my issues let s get on to the dish itself I ve been cooking this very recipe for twenty years Twenty years That s longer than I ve been married had children and American Idol has been on the air I remember sitting around my parents living room my senior year in high school flipping through my mom s Bon Apetit magazine as I was wont to do on the nights I was grounded which was pretty often I found a recipe for Pasta Primavera which I d never heard of before and spent the rest of the evening whipping it up for my parents It was so delicious they ungrounded me right there on the spot Then I went out and got arrested Not really as far as you know But the pasta really really was delicious and provided a wonderful basis for the version I make today Over the years I ve played with the recipe a lot and have finally reached a Pasta Primavera Nirvana a goal to which every self respecting pasta lover should aspire The key lies more in the method than the ingredients indeed using your own personal blend of favorite veggies is part of the fun of this dish I figured out that it s best to cook the vegetables in separate batches and to cook them only very slightly at first Then later when you add them to the creamy flavorful sauce you ll have a little wiggle room to adjust the thickness and seasonings without overcooking them If you cook them all together then create the sauce in the same pan the veggies will invariably overcook and become soggy and lifeless The method I ve figured out ensures a perfectly flavorful sauce and perfectly al dente vegetables which is the secret to perfect Pasta Primavera Let s go for it The Cast of Characters Zucchini Yellow Squash Onion Garlic Broccoli Carrots Mushrooms Red Bell Pepper Frozen Peas Buter Whipping Heavy Cream Half and Half and Parmesan Oh and sliced green onions if you like but I forgot to add them today Either way it s still delish Oh and a glass of dry white wine optional Start with the broccoli get a big chunk or two Then begin cutting it into smaller pieces Then cut off the stems but you ll want to leave them in the dish Now you should have a good cup to cup and a half of bite sized broccoli pieces Now take your onion And cut it in half from top to bottom Now cut off the top Peel away the outer layer Make vertical slices Then rotate it 90 degrees and slice down to dice I like to dice the onion pretty finely Now take the garlic bulb and remove three or four cloves With a heavy jar or can smash each clove And peel away the papery layer Chop the garlic finely Now peel two medium large carrots And slice them on the bias diagonal Now take two zucchini and slice them on the bias too I love zucchini There s something about it that makes me want to sculpt Now get your mushrooms I usually use white button mushrooms but I thought these baby porcinis looked interesting I love mushrooms I mean LOVE There s something about them that makes me want to play Beethoven s Ninth on a ukulele Slice em up roughly No need to be precise I also like to use yellow squash but you don t have to if they scare the living daylights out of you They used to scare me when I was nine At night I d wake up screaming if they ever entered my dreams The pile of veggies is really beginning to grow We re running out of cutting board space Now take the lovely vibrant red pepper Slice off the top Slice off the bottom and either pull or cut out the core If you re bored you could always throw this on your wrist wear it as a bangle and go paint the town red for awhile Oh and that s porcini mushroom under my fingernail not manure Now just cut the pepper in half from top to bottom and slice it into strips I don t know about you but I m tired of cutting vegetables Let s get down to the cookin Now heat 2 tablespoons butter with 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium high skillet Now Important stuff here I believe the key to perfect Pasta Primavera is the vegetables not becoming overcooked In years past I d typically throw all the vegetables into the skillet together cook them thoroughly read too long then actually cook the sauce in the pan with the veggies which would only add to their cooking time By the end though the flavor way great the vegetables would be flaccid and lifeless And I d beat myself over the head with a tenderizing mallet So what we re going to do is cook the vegetables every so slightly in batches Start by adding the chopped onion and garlic together Cook for a minute or two until they start to turn translucent Now throw in the broccoli Stir it around And add in the carrots Stir it around and PLEASE PLEASE cook it for only a minute tops The key here is not to cook the vegetables thoroughly but just to warm them and get them coated in butter oil After you ve cooked them for a minute transfer mixture to a plate Now add in the red pepper strips Stir them around for a minute or so then transfer them to the plate Now s a good time to cook the pasta I like penne but linguini s great too Dump it in slightly salted boiling water and let s get back to the veggies The skillet s looking a little dry and lonely so why dontcha just go ahead and add a tablespoon of butter A tablespoon of butter covers a multitude of sins Now add in the zucchini and squash You definitely don t want to overcook this less than a minute is probably fine I m deathly afraid of overcooking my Pasta Primavera vegetables I ve seriously got to get a life Remove the zucchini squash and add the shrooms to the pan I add a little salt to these Don t ask me why because I rarely have a good reason for doing things Go ahead and cook the mushrooms a minute or two as you don t have to be concerned about keeping them crisp Ain t gonna happen Just look at your lovely plate of undercooked crispy definitely not overcooked veggies Now s the fun part making the creamy sauce Into the empty skillet pour 1 4 to 1 2 cup dry white wine Mmmmm there s no greater smell in the world than that stuff hitting the pan Now add about 1 2 cup low sodium chicken broth If you re averse to wine go ahead and add a whole cup of chicken broth But watch the salt later Stir in a tablespoon or so of butter Now you need to scrape the bottom of the pan I love this flat whisk Isn t it groovy Any whisk will do though Now stir around scraping the flavorful dark bits off the bottom of the pan This ll really add some character to the sauce Cook for a minute or two until liquid starts to thicken Now add 1 cup whipping heavy cream Oh live a little You can get on the Stairmaster later Now add 1 cup half and half See I could have used all cream but I wanted to be health conscious Now take 5 or 6 fresh basil leaves We need to chiffonade the basil Start by rolling the leaves into a somewhat tight ball then make thin slices Hey You just chiffonadedededed basil leaves Your life is complete Now add a nice helping about 1 2 cup grated Parmesan And stir it thoroughly Now taste the sauce and add salt to taste Also add black pepper Fresh ground is best but not mandatory for Pete s sake Really go for it with the pepper It belongs in this sauce Now add in the basil And stir it in The basil rrrrrrrrreally makes this dish so don t be bashful Now dump in all the veggies Mushrooms too And go ahead and dump in about 1 2 cup frozen peas right out of the freezer Now dump in the al dente not overcooked still has bite pasta And stirrrrrrr together Oh geez I m getting hungry Now if the sauce seems a little thick or if there doesn t seem to be enough sauce go ahead and add a good splash of chicken broth and oh what the heck How bout a little more half and half Oh and a little more Parmesan wouldn t hurt A little more salt pepper and we re talking perfection To serve it I like to dump it onto a big platter Hello gorgeous Wanna dance There should be some sauce collecting around the edges I like to throw some more chiffonade of basil all over the top because I m a middle child Here s a close up look at the freaky delicious ridiculous sauce Now go forth and make this Pasta Primavera Your sensory receptors will never be the same And if any of you men try it I want to hear from you I need to believe Prep Time 30 Minutes Cook Time 20 Minutes Difficulty Easy Servings 4 Ingredients 1 cup Bite sized Broccoli Pieces up To 1 1 2 Cups \u00bd whole Onion Diced Finely3 cloves To 4 Cloves Garlic Chopped Finely2 whole Medium To Large Carrots Sliced On The Bias diagonally 2 whole Medium Zucchini Sliced On The

to put out a warning sign for a recipe that say bake at your own risk because the smell will be so good that you will eat the whole things Well for this Cinnamon Sugar Pull Apart Bread I am warning you don t come back here and tell me I didn t Not only does this smell good but it s just a cool bread it pulls apart very easily and it looks cool Do I need to say more Just a few yeast notes because I have had comments before where folks can t get their bread to rise with yeast Few things to think about with yeast especially if you are using dry yeast Make sure your yeast is not old or expired Old yeast either will not rise or takes much longer to rise Secondly make sure your warm ingredients are lukewarm not cold and not too hot Think warm milk to your baby Then let it rise in a warm place I usually put it on my stove and have the light on Cinnamon Sugar Pull Apart Bread Adapted from Joy The Baker Yields one 9x5x3 inch loaf Prep Time 2 hours Bake Time 35 minutes For the Dough 2 3 4 cups plus 2 tbsp all purpose flour1 4 cup granulated sugar2 1 4 tsp 1 envelope active dry yeast1 2 tsp salt2 oz unsalted butter1 3 cup whole milk1 4 cup water2 large eggs at room temperature1 tsp pure vanilla extract For the Filling 1 cup granulated sugar2 tsp ground cinnamon1 2 tsp fresh ground nutmeg2 oz unsalted butter melted until browned In a large mixing bowl whisk together 2 cups flour sugar yeast and salt Set aside Whisk together eggs and set aside In a small saucepan melt together milk and butter until butter has just melted Remove from the heat and add water and vanilla extract Let mixture stand for a minute or two or until the mixture registers 115 to 125 degrees F Pour the milk mixture into the dry ingredients and mix with a spatula Add the eggs and stir the mixture until the eggs are incorporated into the batter The eggs will feel soupy and it ll seem like the dough and the eggs are never going to come together Keep stirring Add the remaining 3 4 cup of flour and stir with the spatula for about 2 minutes The mixture will be sticky That s just right Place the dough is a large greased bowl Cover with a clean kitchen towel Place in a warm space and allow to rest until doubled in size about 1 hour Note The dough can be risen until doubled in size then refrigerated overnight for use in the morning If you re using this method just let the dough rest on the counter for 30 minutes before following the roll out directions below While the dough rises whisk together the sugar cinnamon and nutmeg for the filling Set aside Melt 2 ounces of butter until browned Set aside Grease and flour a 9x5x3 inch loaf pan Set that aside too Deflate the risen dough and knead about 2 tablespoons of flour into the dough Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rest for 5 minutes On a lightly floured work surface use a rolling pin to roll the dough out The dough should be 12 inches tall and about 20 inches long Use a pastry brush to spread melted butter across all of the dough Sprinkle with all of the sugar and cinnamon mixture It might seem like a lot of sugar But just go for it Slice the dough vertically into six equal sized strips Stack the strips on top of one another and slice the stack into six equal slices once again You ll have six stacks of six squares Layer the dough squares in the loaf pan like a flip book Place a kitchen towel over the loaf pan and allow in a warm place for 30 to 45 minutes or until almost doubled in size Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F Place loaf in the oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes until the top is very golden brown The top may be lightly browned but the center may still be raw A nice dark golden brown will ensure that the center is cooked as well Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 20 to 30 minutes Run a butter knife around the edges of the pan to loosen the bread and invert onto a clean board Place a cake stand or cake plate on top of the upside down loaf and carefully invert so it s right side up Serve warm with coffee or tea This bread is best served the day it s made but it can also we wrapped and kept at room temperature for up to 2 days Next week is my birthday and to

beverages the problem is most of these same people don t realize the volume of calories they are putting in their bodies when they consume these products Even freshly squeezed juices are very calorie dense If you are pounding back any of these drinks on a regular basis cutting them out could do wonders for your waste line without even adding in any exercise This list will be from the least calorie dense drinks all the way up to the super calorie dense options And since I am such a nice guy I m even going to suggest a few low calorie alternatives to help give you something to sip on over the day 8 7 11 Cola SlurpeeThis one seems almost obvious although I was shocked to see it this low on the list when compared to some of the other popular drinks Slurpee Nutritional InfoOz 24 Calories 210Fat 0gCarbs 53 9gProtein Sugar 53 9gCalories Per oz 8 75Alternatives to SlurpeesWhile I personally love a Slurpee on a hot summers day one alternative is a home made calorie free Slurpee Take your blender mix in roughly 1 2 cup of pre made crystal light and then add roughly half a tray of ice cubes more if you want it slushier Blend the concoction up for a calorie free Slurpee 7 Pepsi Cola Coca Cola Another obvious one near the top of the list is sugar packed sodas such as Coke or Pepsi Your average 12oz serving has roughly 150 calories If you drink three cans a day that s 160200 calories a year which is roughly 45 lbs of PURE FAT Pepsi Nutritional Info Oz 12Calories 150Fat 0gCarbs 42gProtein Sugar 42gCalories Per oz 12 50Alternatives to Pepsi Coke SodasThis is actually a really easy fix if you are willing to make a bit of a change Switch from Pepsi to Diet Pepsi The taste might not be that pleasing at first but after a few weeks you don t even notice the aftertaste any more I personally actually prefer diet sodas over regular these days If you drink diet soda you are 100 reducing these drink calories from your diet 6 Fresh Orange JuiceYes you are reading this correctly Juices are jam packed full of calories whether you are drinking apple juice orange juice or grape juice they all contain a ton of sugar and a ton of unnecessary calories If you really just want some vitamin C take a supplement or eat an actual orange and get some of the fiber to go along with it Fresh Orange Juice Nutrition InfoOz 12Calories 170Fat 0 8gCarbs 39 2gProtein 2 6Sugar 31 7gCalories Per oz 14 17Fresh Juice Alternatives If you are drinking juice for Vitamins eat the fruit and get some of the benefits of the fiber If you are just looking for something that has some flavor mix up some Crystal Light and enjoy a tasty calorie free drink 5 GatoradeIf Gatorade is good for athletes it has got to be good for me right WRONG Gatorade was developed to help athletes quickly replenish depleted energy sources and as a result is jam packed full of sugar as well as calories Unless you are performing at a very high level athletically drinking Gatorade is only going to build your spare tire around your waste Gatorade Nutrition Info Oz 12Calories 170Fat 0 8gCarbs 39 2gProtein 2 6Sugar 31 7gCalories Per oz 25 83Gatorade Alternatives If you really want to drink a sports drink pickup one of Gatorade s new G2 sports drinks It is a low calorie alternative and won t turn you into an overweight wannabe athlete 4 Starbucks Mint Chocolaty Chip Frappuccino blended creme with Chocolate Whipped Cream Let s face it you shouldn t be drinking Starbucks Frappuccino s if you are trying to watch your waste line They are so packed full of calories you could easily gain a pound a week by drinking a Venti every day One Frapp stands out in the crowd for being the ultimate weight gainer and that is the Mint Chocolaty Chip Frappuccino blended cr\u00e8me with Chocolate Whipped Cream try saying that 5 times This drink is a behemoth with 680 calories in a single 24oz serving That is an astounding 28 33 calories per oz If you are planning on dressing up as Santa Clause this winter and don t want to stuff your pants with pillows this is definitely the daily beverage for you Starbucks Mint Chocolaty Chip Frappuccino blended creme with Chocolate Whipped Cream Nutrition InfoOz 24Calories 680Fat 21gCarbs 115gProtein 18Sugar 93gCalories Per oz 28 33Frappuccino Alternatives If you are really feeling the urge to get a blended Frapp from Starbucks first step is to look at the light section The next step is to select the Espresso Frappuccino Light Blended Coffee A Venti 24oz serving still has 150 calories but that is substantially better than its Mint Chocolaty companion For those who care the Espresso Frappuccino Light Blended Coffee packs 6 25 calories per oz 3 7 11 French Vanilla Caf\u00e9 Cooler7 11 got a little upset when Starbucks started stealing their grown up Slurpee customers who wanted blended coffee So what did they do They came up with Coffee Slurpees to stir up the competition Unlucky for us though these Slurpees come packed with nearly four times the calories of a traditional Slurpee Check out the nutritional information on these tasty morsels 7 11 French Vanilla Caf\u00e9 Cooler Nutrition Info Oz 20 Calories 634Fat 27gCarbs 97gProtein 1 6Sugar 97gCalories Per oz 31 70French Vanilla Caf\u00e9 Alternatives Honestly if you have to buy something from 7 11 to replace your French Vanilla Caf\u00e9 Cooler I would recommend grabbing a cup of coffee toss a bit of skim milk and some sugar free Vanilla syrup in it Run over to the Big Gulp machine and toss a few ice cubes in your cup to cool it down and make a chilled beverage Aside from that any of the caf\u00e9 coolers are pretty much going to turn you into a fat air balloon 2 McDonald s Chocolate Triple Thick ShakeLeave it to McDonalds to have the second most fattening drink that I have ever seen If you ve ever tasted their Chocolate Triple Thick Shake you would know instantly that there is no way something with so much creamy tasty flavor could ever be good for you This calorie behemoth could help you pack on as much as two pounds of fat a week when combined with your normal diet Pretty impressive huh Chocolate Triple Thick Shake Nutrition Info Oz 32 Calories 1160Fat 27gCarbs 203gProtein 27Sugar 168gCalories Per oz 36 25Chocolate Triple Thick Shake Alternatives If you really want to drink a Chocolate milk shake you are looking at a calorie dense beverage no matter what way you shake it If you want to make something that is at least somewhat healthy for you blend 1 2 cup skim milk with 2 scoops chocolate whey protein and half a tray of ice It will taste like a chocolate milk shake with way less sugar but you still can t avoid the calories 1 Bubble Tea with Milk and Tapioca PearlsBubble Tea is an Asian drink that has many variations these days The original Bubble Tea came from Taiwan and was a combination of Black tea condensed milk honey and pearls tapioca balls These days the black tea and condensed milk can be substituted with fruity teas or milky fruit teas all of which are jam packed with gut producing calories A standard Bubble Tea with milk and pearls contains roughly 510 calories in just a 12 oz serving If you just broke out your calculator you would now know that Bubble tea can contain 42 50 calories per oz What does that mean for you It means that Bubble Tea is a one way ticket to Obesity Boulevard Bubble Tea with Milk and Tapioca Pearls Nutritional Info Oz 12 Calories 510Fat 20 4gCarbs 79 05gProtein 6Sugar gCalories Per oz 42 50Bubble Tea Alternatives Alright this one you are going to have to suck up and just stop drinking There is absolutely no reason why you need to eat Tapioca balls and condensed milk on a daily basis Hit up your grocery store and grab a couple boxes of black and green tea Not only will it save your health it will also save you some

distracted cranky mentally sick and drained of energy They suffer from their inability to focus and generate interesting ideas a lack of inspiration and inability to perform daily activities at an optimal level etc Sometimes we feel absolutely emptied out and worn out and in many of us this condition has turned into a chronic one What to do How to prevent it First of all let s look at the reasons and the habits that drain our energy all the time Habit One A constant lack of sleep and proper rest No one should underestimate the importance of regular restful sleep but unfortunately up to 65 of today s population suffer from regular lack of sleep We can t get enough of sleep during the weekdays and as a result we are trying to compensate it during the weekend this way damaging our inner clock and causing various imbalances in the body As a result we start feeling worn out cranky distressed and like a boiled rag Habit Two Internet addiction This is a really bad habit which causes many negative consequences Excessive internet communication like checking out email massages sending instant messages and checking out voicemail social networking etc takes a lot of time and energy distracts our attention makes us tired of multitasking and does not allow us to do enough of exercise Control your daily activities in the office and do not allow internet addiction swallow you completely Habit Three Healthy eating addiction Due to massive campaigns in modern mass media supporting various types of diets and diet plans many people especially young ladies tend to drain themselves out with diets and not eating anything They feel sad and dejected for their being unable to put off weight so they occasionally give up eating completely and suffer from chronic hunger This everything is really exhausting and those women who want to be always successful attractive and energetic should avoid such experiments like not eating all the time Habit Four Overeating This is an antipode of habit three Some people are convinced that the more they eat the more energetic and active they are going to be They do not mind consuming large meals filled with sugars and carbohydrates which have destructive effects on their digestive and cardio vascular systems In addition overeating always slows down the function of all body systems and evokes a feeling of sleepiness To be on top energy levels it is recommended to eat small portions every 3 4 hours Habit Five Caffeine addiction Many of us start our day with a cup of coffee but not all of us know that the effects of drinking 4 5 cups of coffee a day are directly opposed to the effects of drinking 1 2 cups The more coffee you drink the less energy you have for your daily activities because coffee stimulates dehydration and makes your body tired of reducing the effects of excessive caffeine Control your daily consumption of coffee and caffeinated drinks and try to dink more water Habit Six Chronic pains This factor is among the most exhausting and killing ones which drains our energy a lot Chronic pains can be caused by various types of sicknesses ailments and injuries These pains are prolonged and sometimes persistent and they require a lot of patience and willpower to cope with Very often they cause insomnia depression a lack of appetite self confidence and physical activities inability to focus and so on Certainly this everything affects our life quality to a great extent Therefore chronic pains should be properly treated in order to reduce their energy draining effects Habit Seven A lack of fresh air This factor can cause excessive toxins in your body allergies slowed down thyroid function stresses and dropped down energy levels Find some time to go out especially when you get tired or feel lack of energy Habit Eight A lack of sunlight If your work is connected with lots of thinking generating various ideas and making various decisions it can be essential to expose yourself to good amounts of sunlight which stimulates brainwork and helps to focus When you wake up in the morning enjoy the first sunrays which can give signals to your brain about the beginning of a new day This is a very effective way to reduce energy draining effects since the early morning Habit Nine Unsolved emotional problems Hate or anger pity or sadness all sorts of emotional burden affect our mental condition and drain our energy It is highly important not to avoid resolving your emotional issues otherwise your chances to live your life in depressions exhaustion and emotional imbalances are very high Author Info Hi My name is Carla and I am a 5th year medical student at HYMS I am interested in alternative medicine and I have done months researching the topic of herbal medicine Besides I like

Body Balanced Lifestyle Balanced Mind and Soul Balanced Nutrition March 9 2010 13 Comments This post was written by Anastasiya Follow me on Twitter or StumbleUpon and keep your life balanced When you hear the word heart what do you think about Do you think about a heart attack or do you think about love do you think about health or do you think about kindness and generosity Maybe some of you will think about Ann and Nancy Wilson and will get the song Barracuda stuck in your heads but this is not the heart I am talking about I am not sure if you ve heard about it or not but February was heart awareness month I know that February is long gone I might be a little behind but I do have a calendar on my desktop but our heart is with us every day and every second of our lives Do we really need to be aware of it just one month a year A healthy and strong heart is what lets us enjoy our life it lets us be healthy and happy it lets us be open to new experiences and love Our heart is what makes us alive in a physical and spiritual sense Your heart is the ultimate indicator of how much balance you have in your life because your lifestyle has the biggest impact on your ticker I want to challenge you to take care of your heart today and every day from now on There are hundreds of things that you can do that will ensure that your heart stays young in both senses all your life A merry heart doeth good like a medicine but a broken spirit drieth the bones Proverbs 17 22 Taking care of your heart only physically is not enough A recent study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine showed that keeping your weight under control having your BMI under 30 being active and not smoking reduced risks of dying prematurely of any chronic disease including cardiovascular disease by 80 Can you think of any pill that can do the same But these changes will not be enough if you forget about the other side of your heart That side is rejuvenated through kindness love affection friendship and faith Let me show you 77 7 ways how you can keep your heart healthy and open to the world every day of your life Nutrition Keep your plate bright The more colorful your diet is the more phytonutrients you are getting that can ward off heart disease obesity and cancer Be sweet savvy A diet high in sugars just two or three sweetened drinks are already too much leads to high blood pressure Cut down on any refined sugars and especially high fructose corn syrup Use natural sweeteners If you still want to satisfy your sweet cravings opt for natural sweeteners like fruit honey and organic maple syrup because these sweet treats combine sugar fructose with vitamins and fiber that are so important for a healthy heart Do not go overboard though everything is good in moderation Follow the 80 20 rule It is great to eat healthy all the time but it is virtually impossible Leave a 20 room for any unhealthy cravings fast food on a road trip or a big party with chips and creamy dips Cut back on saturated fats No matter what your age and risk factors are it will help you to lower your LDL cholesterol bad cholesterol and live a longer life Limit saturated fat to 7 of your daily calories 10 to 11 grams Reduce your sodium intake Sodium increases your risks of hypertension that makes your heart work harder and wear out faster Table salt is usually not your biggest enemy because most of the sodium in our diets come from fast foods and processed foods Eat a clean diet Clean diet is the one that is low in processed foods and that uses as many natural products as possible Some of the examples are eating an orange instead of drinking orange juice fixing your own chicken for sandwiches instead of using deli meats choosing whole wheat bread and pasta instead of white varieties Be full of beans One third of a cup of cooked beans daily can lower your chances of having a heart attack by 38 Cut back on breakfast cereals While there are some healthy options most cereals are far from being a healthy start of the day Too much sugar no vitamins or fiber high levels of sodium and even trans fats turn this traditional breakfast food into a disaster for your heart Before you buy your next box take your time to read the label and choose the most natural and healthy cereal Sip some tea The antioxidants in green and black tea improve blood vessel function and increase blood flow Drink your tea without sugar eat a few dried apricots or add some honey to give it a sweet note and choose organic loose tea that has not been stripped of all healthy nutrients Go bananas Bananas are the most heart healthy fruits because they have high levels of potassium Dried apricots and prunes are also excellent sources of this mineral Have a baked potato Spuds are a top source of potassium a mineral that can offset the effects of sodium Drink your veggies You can get an extra serving of vegetables by drinking a low sodium vegetable juice It is even better to make your own juice at home and drink it for breakfast do not forget to add some apples and carrots to make this juice drinkable Go Italian Italian cuisine uses tomatoes and tomato sauce abundantly and it is your best bet to lower your risks of heart attack or stroke by 65 Spaghetti with Marinara sauce vegetarian lasagna and pizza with half the cheese and double the sauce are excellent ideas for any heart healthy meals Eat salmon and sardines for lunch These varieties of fish are great sources of omega 3 fatty acids that protect you against inflammation and lower triglycerides Have a salmon sandwich instead of tuna or mix sardines with spicy mustard and red onions and serve them with bread or crackers Spice up your meals Onions and garlic might not be your best choice if you are going on a romantic date or an important interview but they can remove excess LDL cholesterol from your body Onions and garlic also will give a nice flavor to any dish without adding extra salt or fat Get hot Hot peppers and hot sauce of course contain a chemical called capsaicin that protects your heart and arteries from any possible problems You can read more here Start your day with oatmeal It won t only give you enough energy to survive the most demanding day it will also lower your cholesterol and general risks of heart disease Top it with blueberries bananas or walnuts or sprinkle some cinnamon to make it deliciously healthy Be smart when eating out Just because you are going out does not mean that you should forget about heart healthy meals Most restaurants can cook healthy meals in a way that you have never tried them before your taste buds won t even notice the difference Share portions or take half of the portion home avoid appetizers and bread with butter ask your waiter for sauces and gravies on the side do not order fried breaded or tempura dishes Ask your waiter how your meal is prepared and what ingredients are used Satisfy your eyes not only your mouth Moderate eating is the best strategy to keep your weight under control weight is one of the decisive factors when it comes to heart disease If you make your meal look pleasing to the eye you will get satisfied faster without consuming extra calories One of the reasons why every meal at a restaurant tastes so good is because chefs take time to organize every plate in the most eye pleasing way Cut down on coffee consumption There are studies that suggest that coffee is beneficial to your heart in the long run but moderation is the key in this case One medium Starbucks has the daily allowed amount of caffeine so do not go overboard One cup of coffee a day is a safe way to benefit your heart help you wake up and satisfy your cravings Go nuts Nuts can help you lower your LDL bad cholesterol while providing your body with essential fatty acids fiber and protein Walnuts are considered the best nuts because they have the highest amount of omega 3s but other nuts almonds pecans pistachios hazelnuts are good too Eat about a handful a day as a snack or mix them into the salad or main dish Remember that you can cancel out the health benefits of nuts if they are covered with salt chocolate or sugar Order curry at a restaurant or cook it yourself The spice that gives curry its vibrant yellow color is turmeric This spice has been used in Asian medicine for a long time and recent research suggests that curcumin a natural ingredient in turmeric and ginger can dramatically decrease the chances of developing heart failure reverse and prevent cardiac hypertrophy This spice also has a dozen other health benefits that will improve your health and mood at the same time Turmeric tastes great if you add it to chicken beans rice beef and vegetables Experiment in the chicken or make a reservation at an Indian restaurant Have dark chocolate for dessert Dark chocolate 70 cacao content or higher has shown to lower blood pressure Eat a few squares for a desert or drink some dark cocoa avoid sugar as much as possible to take care of your heart and taste buds Drink red wine in moderation Red wine is considered one of the reasons Mediterranean diet is so healthy for your heart Low amounts of alcohol together with antioxidants prevent heart disease by increasing levels of good cholesterol and protecting against artery damage Cut back on eating out and take outs We all know that restaurant portions are oversized but most dishes are also high in sodium or fat eating out a couple of times a month won t harm you but making it a weekly practice can harm your heart waste line and wallet all at the same time Be smart Eat mindfully Mindful eating is when you eat only when you are hungry not stressed or bored when you pay attention to the way your food tastes and when you take your time savoring every bite as opposed to shoveling it down on the run If you eat mindfully you will be able to lose unnecessary weight and prevent the scale from creeping up Read food labels Avoid foods with any partially hydrogenated oils saturated fat and especially trans fats because they are deadly for your body and heart Snack on dried fruit Dried fruit have the same health benefits as regular ones but in concentrated form They are rich in fiber essential for lowering cholesterol vitamins and potassium I love munching on dried dates apricots or prunes They are a healthy way for me to satisfy my sweet tooth and take care of my heart at the same time Exercise Be active all day If you are active in little ways throughout the day gardening cleaning the house running errands then your heart will be healthier than the one of a person who exercises for 30 60 minutes and then sits at the computer all day long Interval training It is the best type of exercise for prevention of heart disease and diabetes Follow a 3 1 ratio while exercising 3 minutes of moderately paced activities followed by 1 minute of high intensity activities You can try it while walking and running or you can combine different types of exercise like lunges and jumps Just 20 minutes of interval training is as effective for your heart as the whole hour of moderate exercise Be flexible A recent study in Japan has found that people who were limber after 40 has 30 less stiffness in the arteries Stretch for 10 15 minutes every day to keep your arteries pliable Try Yoga Yoga does not provide any cardiovascular benefits as any aerobic activity does but it lowers your levels of stress and keeps your arteries elastic Yoga also soothes your nervous system which lowers blood pressure and makes heart rates steady Add resistance bands to your home gym This inexpensive prop can spruce up any boring workout and help you build muscle mass that reduces your body fat and raises levels of good cholesterol HDL Follow these guidelines The American Heart Association recommends that you get 30 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity on 5 days of the week or 20 minutes of vigorous intensity exercise on 3 days each week Strength training is recommended at least 2 times every week Do enjoyable exercise It is important for your body to move and for your heart to get a workout but it is also important to enjoy what you are doing If you love your type of exercise then you are more likely to stick with for many healthy years You will experience body and mind benefits if you choose wisely Lifestyle Cuddle up with a fur ball A recent study published in USA Today shows that cat owners cut their risks of heart attack by almost a third Scientists suggest that dogs provide similar benefits because both help to relieve stress of their owners Quit smoking This one does not need explanation if you want to have a healthy life Keep your BMI under 30 preferably around 18 5 25 BMI is a body mass index that can be easily calculated using this formula BMI weight in pounds 703 height in inches 2Mine is 18 8 What is yours Get busy under sheets Men and women who have sex at least 2 3 times a week decrease their risks of heart disease by 50 study published in the American Journal of Cardiology Isn t it a good enough reason to have a romantic night out today and every day Take a vitamin D supplement Vitamin D the one that is important for your bone strength also plays a very important role in protecting you from heart disease Vitamin D deficiency doubles the risks of dying from a heart disease by 50 according to the Framingham Heart Study Ask your physician to test your blood for vitamin D and take a supplement if needed Go out in the sunshine Vitamin D as stated in the previous tip is essential for the heart health Before you start taking any supplements spend 10 15 minutes in the noon sun on most days of the week Do not use any sunscreen during this sunshine exposure because sunscreen blocks UV B light bands that produce vitamin D in our bodies Wear a hat and cover your face but let as many parts of your body as possible be exposed to the sun Get enough sleep Anxiety bad mood and irritability are not the only consequences of not getting enough sleep Skimping on sleep can promote calcium buildup in the arteries which can lead to a heart attack causing plaque Listen to joyful and calming music Researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore have shown for the first time that the emotions aroused by joyful music have a healthy effect on blood vessel function Music provides the same effects as laughter so tune into your favorite melody as often as possible Have a few green plants in your house Seeing green increases happiness and creativity and decreases stress levels according to a study from Washington State University Plants also clean the air in your house or office from pollutants like chemicals and dust that can trigger rapid spikes in blood pressure Stress Management Socialize Going out with your friends can be as heart healthy as hitting the gym Lonely people who do not communicate with their friends a lot had 10 30 points higher blood pressure than their more sociable peers Detach from stuff We surround ourselves with tons of things that make our life easier that bring certain pleasures into our lives and that look nice or help us kill time when we are bored Practice detachment from all this stuff and you will find your heart to be much more open to everything around you Have a plan for a stressful situation We cannot avoid all stressful situations in our life but we can prepare for them Make it a rule to think of one positive thing in your life whenever stressful thoughts start creeping into your head or carry a list of things that you are grateful for Another idea is to have a few pictures of the happiest moments of your life or people who always bring happiness in your life with you Take a tech break Being plugged in all the time puts you on the edge and increases the production of stress hormones that cause your blood pressure to rise Turn off your cell phone in the evening do not check your email and log off any IM system Have this time to yourself not somebody else Meditate Meditation calms your mind and your heart at the same time Practice it daily or at least 3 times a week Get organized Why is it relevant to your heart Cluttered environments suppress your productivity and increase your stress levels which affect the health of your heart Stop being a perfectionist Perfectionism will cause a lot of unnecessary stress in your life that will eventually damage your heart When you feel that you are striving for the perfect whatever repeat to yourself Good is good enough Enjoy your time in silence and solitude Make it a habit to spend some time alone weekly to let your mind float away your stress dissolve in the air and your heart open to the miracles of the world Slow down in life Fast paced life leads to depression and stress it undermines your ability to enjoy time with your family or doing things you love All these factors are important for a healthy and open heart Have a me break Giving working helping taking care of others are all honorable missions but you need some time for yourself Do not consider it pampering or selfishness This is your chance to get reacquainted with yourself and to have some rest from the world around you no matter how wonderful it might be Let yourself relax Being in the always ready condition is very stressful Let somebody else take care of the kids order a take out not more than twice a month remember take a day off at work and let yourself completely relax Your heart will enjoy this break from your busy lifestyle Happiness and Kindness Surround yourself with positive people Negative friends can drain you and increase your levels of stress Try to hang out only with positive people and you will notice how your own levels of optimism will shift Be happy According to a recent study in Nova Scotia Canada happiness and general positivity protects heart from any degenerative disease Laugh Just 15 minutes of laughter daily can boost your blood flow by 22 percent and prevent your arteries from hardening Call a funny friend or watch a comedy every day Speak up Bottling up your feelings won t do your heart or your relationships any favor If something is bothering you bring it up and resolve the issue once and for all Do something enjoyable In order to up your happiness levels spend 15 20 minutes a day doing something that you like Do not abandon it if your schedule gets too busy Practice random acts of kindness While you are taking care of your physical heart do not forget that you are more complex than a machine Kind heart is as important as low cholesterol for your health Be kind for no apparent reason and find deepest joy in this kindness Savor joyful events If something amazing happens in your life remember this event and go over it when you are feeling down Practice forgiveness Holding a grudge will harden your heart and close it to the entire world Forgive people and move on with your life Visualize your best self If you are not satisfied with yourself then think of what would make you completely happy with yourself Visualize this picture every day and start taking small steps to reach this goal Be generous Generosity boosts happiness on an everyday basis Start small by giving smiles to everybody around you and give as much as your heart wants to Be positive Both optimists and pessimists have bad days but optimists get over those days quickly while pessimists savor their sufferings and complain about their lives constantly No matter what the day brings you choose to be positive and concentrate on good things around you Express your heart s desires Our creativity is born in our heart and if we suppress any spark of it then we also block our hearts from happiness Express whatever is born in your heart to keep your heart young and open for life Show some self love Take care of your needs as much as you take care of others Even though being generous is a key to keeping your heart young you must still learn to be generous to yourself Do not be a martyr because the times when it was appreciated are long gone Say a prayer Open your heart to God and he will take care of you Say a prayer from your heart and you will feel that any of your burdens have been lifted and your heart will be touched by Him Practice gratitude Be grateful for what you have and for what will come be grateful even for what you do not have because chances are that you are better off without it Try something new Keep your heart open to new experiences by trying something new as often as possible This practice will keep your heart agile and young for many years and when you are 60 70 or 100 you will not consider yourself an old wreck You will be a person who has lived and is still living his her life with a young heart Follow your passion Following your passion will help you live a more fulfilling life it will help you fight stress in life and be happy in general If you can earn living by following your passion then it is great go for it But if not just devote some time in your busy schedule to do what you are passionate about whether it is writing cooking or just playing with your kids Help somebody Helping people around you whether these are people you know or complete strangers is the best way to keep your heart open kind and young According to the research Peggy Thoits Professor of Sociology at Vanderbilt University volunteering increased happiness life satisfaction self esteem sense of control over life physical health and decreased depression It is healthy to be good Kiss hug touch Little things like holding hands hugging kissing lovingly and cuddling are the signs of a strong couple Strong couples have better emotional and intellectual connections they have better and more frequent sex and they have less amounts of stress which leads to heart disease This is a no brainer if you want to take care of your heart take care of your relationship and treasure the connection physical and mental that you have By the way non sexual hugs and touches with friends or family members have proved to increase happiness and even lower blood pressure hold a hug for at least 6 seconds Be patient Patience brings many benefits but the most heart healthy one is less stress in your life You do not have to get mad when you sit in a traffic jam or waste your time standing in a line Distract yourself with pleasant thoughts about your family plan your supper ahead of time or think about ideas for a new business Find your virtues A strong heart is a virtuous heart because this heart knows how to do the right thing for the right reason 7 Do not let your heart go numb When you feel that you avoid new experiences new emotions new adventures because you are scared of pain and disappointment know that you are intentionally blocking your heart You are suffocating it by not letting it live and breathe fully Do not be scared open up and embrace life instead of hiding from it Share experience with your loved ones Our society has become too materialistic Our expression of love or apology usually has a price tag on it Money can buy you a comfortable life but it can t buy you happiness Spend quality time with the people you care about and enjoy every moment together See miracles around you Our life is full of miracles that we often do not notice Train yourself to see those miracles around you a birth of a child or wonderful butterfly in your yard are both miracles and you will notice that your life will get more positive Find the meaning of your life Meaningless life leads to an empty heart and an empty heart has no way of staying healthy and young Live a meaningful life that fills your heart Be childlike not childish Children are honest joyful full of energy open to the world full of love for the entire world not scared of anything and absolutely adorable Play with them spend as much time with them as possible and learn from them This is the best way to maintain your youthfulness inside and out Enjoy your life Focus on enjoying every moment of your life and making every moment count What is the point of living a life even with a healthy heart if this life is empty and boring Do things try things be brave lose your fears love be passionate and stay positive Make decisions that you will be proud of and avoid mistakes that you will regret Make it all count Be in love Love opens our hearts and makes us bloom all year round Cherish the love that you have and try to stay in love until the last day of your life Love and magic have a great deal in common They enrich the soul delight the heart And they both take practice Nora Roberts I am not asking you to read

"",""body"":""The giveaway is now closed but I hope you still enjoy the Nutella Stuffed Cookies After making the first batch of Chocolate Nutella Fudge with Sea Salt last year my family kids grandparents and brother in law included immediately determined it was a must have for each Christmas to be served alongside my husband s great grandmother s spritz butter cookies and my dad s killer ginger cookies Yeah okay twist my arm That fudge set off a cascade of gooey chocolate and hazelnut baking in our house from Chewy Nutella Oatmeal Bars to Nutella Cream Cheese Swirled Blondies It was only a matter of time before the Nutella weaseled its way into the center of my favorite sugar cookie recipe typically made with crumbled Heath Bars When making drop cookies I like to be fairly precise about the size of each cookie so that they cook as evenly as possible No loosey goosey dropping from a spoon in this elf s kitchen For years I have used cookie scoops such as the OXO ones you see in the photos below to dole out an equal amount of batter It makes the process of doling out the dough go quickly and the scoops are fun for little hands to use too You can use the small scoops for bite sized cookies medium scoops for your average sized treats and large scoops for those gargantuan cookies like what you may see in your favorite bakery Of course if you decide to make bite sized cookies that means you get to eat a minimum of three cookies Santa s rule I swear on Rudolph s shiny red nose It s a good thing this rule exists because it is virtually impossible to eat only one of these cookies For details on entering the OXO baking giveaway scroll down You don t want to miss it Again on Rudolph s shiny red nose The recipe Using a 1 teaspoon measure scoop out Nutella and place in small mounds on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper Place in the freezer for 15 minutes Place an oven rack in the middle position and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper In a medium bowl whisk together flour baking powder and salt In a large bowl beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer set on medium speed until the mixture is creamy and fluffy 3 to 5 minutes Beat in eggs one at a time and vanilla extract Turn the mixer to low speed and gradually beat in the flour mixture until it is just combined Using a rubber spatula stir the mixture a few times to make sure all of the flour mixture is incorporated Place 1 3 cup granulated sugar in a small bowl Use 2 tablespoons cookie dough for each cookie Split the piece of dough in half and slightly flatten the bottom half Sprinkle 5 or 6 grains of sea salt on the dough Use a small metal spatula to lift the mounds of Nutella from the baking sheet and lay on the bottom half of cookie dough on top of the salt If the Nutella starts to soften place back in the freezer for a few minutes Cover with the other piece of cookie dough Seal the edges with your fingers Roll the ball in the sugar to coat it and place it on a prepared baking sheet Bake the cookies one sheet a time rotating from front to back halfway through baking They are done when the edges are set and beginning to brown 10 to 13 minutes The centers of the cookies should still be soft and puffy Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes Using a spatula

line - loneplacebo loneplacebo how to download youtube videos via the command line"",""body"":""I don t purport this tutorial as being the ideal way to download Youtube videos to your computer A simple Google search will lead you to an assortment of options that requires less technical expertise However if you re like me and are relatively new to the command line think your OS without the GUI and a mouse this might be an interesting way to accomplish something relatively useful download Youtube videos to your computer and also learn how to directly communicate with your computer In this tutorial I ll be using a command line program called youtube dl Sorry Window users This walkthrough is tailored for Mac Linux users However there is a nice write up here which you can follow as well Working with Terminal The Basics I m no command line genius maybe just a hair above a beginner I know how to navigate my way through the system directory output files folders copy delete stuff and open applications Thankfully that should be enough for completing this guide First download and save the youtube dl program to your computer here You should right click the link and select Save Link As and save the file with the Python extension py Next open up Terminal on your Mac Type in cd usr local NOTE This is a hidden directory on your computer system where some of the core programs are being handled Thus I urge extra caution when working here I also like to use the ls command which outputs a list of all the files and directories I can navigate to next based on my current location Go ahead and try it now Next type into Terminal open bin Click to enlarge A new Finder window should appear containing a bunch of cryptic looking files The reason why we have to navigate to this folder via Terminal is because by default it is a hidden system folder meaning it can t be reached via Finder alone There is a Terminal command to display all hidden files by default but it is generally advised not to do so Press Authenticate and enter your login credentials Paste your youtube dl py file now in the bin folder you are in A pop up will appear telling you that you don t have permission to do so Select Authenticate and enter your login password Verify that the file was correctly saved to the directory Currently in Terminal we are sitting inside the usr local directory Next type in cd bin This moves you into the bin folder where you had saved the youtube dl py file to in the previous step A short intro to file permissions File permissions determine which users can perform a certain action on specific files and directories There are read r write w and execute x permissions and are assigned to three types of users a user u b group g and c other o Read the following articles for a more further details The reason why I mention file permissions is because you will need to edit the file permissions for the youtube dl py file currently residing in your bin folder At the moment the file only has read and write access to the user which is you You can view the permissions using the ls command mentioned earlier by including the l option which displays extra details So typing in the following ls l while in the bin directory should display something like this rwxrwxr x 1 tonyhue staff 66816 Jan 10 2011 twdiff rwxrwxr x 1 tonyhue staff 77120 Jan 10 2011 twfind rw r xr x 1 tonyhue staff 139584 Oct 20 18 33 youtube dl py There should be other files but I only included the last three which includes the youtube dl py file You can also check the permissions for a specific file directory by using the g option ls lg youtube dl py In order for the program to run you need to give yourself execution permission Currently youtube dl py has read and write access To add execution permission we will use the chmod command by typing in chmod u x youtube dl py Verify that the correct permissions for the file contain read write and execution permission by typing in ls lg youtube dl py Almost there Congrats You ve hopefully made it this far unscathed After modifying the permissions for the youtube dl py file you can now start downloading Youtube videos to your computer from the command line Just type in youtube dl py youtube video link Don t include the bracket parenthesis Things should be working properly if Terminal outputs something that looks like this youtube w639H9ZUqZw Downloading video webpage youtube w639H9ZUqZw Downloading video info webpage youtube w639H9ZUqZw Extracting video information download Destination w639H9ZUqZw mp4 download 100 0 of 9 53M at 9 06M s ETA 00 00 Don t fret if you start getting error messages Try restarting Terminal and attempting again Verify that youtube dl py has rwx permissions Also check to see if you remembered to include the py extension If all has gone according to plan you should be able to find your newly downloaded video in your Users folder Yeah I know Terrible place to put it amiright What else Pat yourself on the back once more You ve successfully downloaded a Youtube video to your computer Youtube dl has a number of available options to customize the video you download such as changing the video filename to the video s title instead of its id Also the program can also download videos from other sources besides Youtube including Vimeo Daily Motion and Metacafe The sky is the limit majoring in technology downloading videos off youtube is such a common ritual on the internet, but how about doing it via the command line? command line, terminal, youtube videos, download youtube

a sandwich too ugly to look at let alone eat I m talking about those structure less mayo bombs served on soggy white bread An egg salad sandwich fitting this description shows up at my house roughly once a week wrapped in tight fitting plastic pretty much whenever Wayne hits up the neighborhood sandwich shop I always look at him incredulously and ask really You really want to eat that I just don t get it Generally speaking he doesn t even like eggs very much Whoever cast the egg salad sandwich spell on him did a fine job It wasn t until last week when we went to the Vivienne Westwood exhibit at the de Young museum that I was forced to rethink my position At the caf\u00e9 my friend Quyen submitted her sandwich order one egg salad please I looked at her and shook my head You too This in turn opened up a lengthy lunchtime conversation on the merit of egg salad Egg Salad Sandwich Lovers 2 Haters 1 My case wasn t helped by what was about to come out of the caf\u00e9 kitchen When her sandwich appeared before us the clouds parted angels sang and a golden beam of sunlight was cast onto her plate It was an egg salad sandwich of a totally different breed You could see vibrant yellow yolks flecks of herbs and capers Mayo Little if any And the best part Not a soggy piece of bread in sight And this is how inspiration strikes I saw Quyen s tasty looking egg salad sandwich and it showed me that a sandwich made of hard boiled eggs can be appetizing to both the eye and the taste buds I thought about it for a few days and came up with a game plan for my own that went something like this For the bread whole grain bread toasted and sliced on the thin side Toasting will help deter the sog factor Some crunchy add ins were going to be critical to counter the mush factor of the eggs My choice Chopped celery Eggs pair beautifully with herbs at the market I was on the lookout for fresh dill but came across chives instead Perfect I knew I was after a drier egg salad mixture and would use a minimal amount of mayo just enough to bind the egg mixture together Achieving bright yellow yolks would be of the utmost importance A friend of my sister s recommended chopped bacon as an addition I countered with fried shallots but didn t end up using them at the last minute the flavor was overpowering the eggs and chives If you wanted to go that route a remix of this sandwich where you broil some thinly sliced gruyere cheese onto your toast top with the egg salad mixture sprinkle with the fried shallots and serve open faced would likely be delicious It also dawned on me that this is prime egg salad sandwich season Put all those leftover hard boiled eggs from Easter to good use I should note that we always had leftover hardboiled eggs that we didn t use in the hunt Before I sign off I d like to thank everyone for the overwhelmingly enthusiastic response to the Unwilling Cook s letter earlier this week 180 fantastic thoughtful responses and they are STILL coming in It makes me very proud to have such an amazing community of readers and I promise to keep you posted on his progress I ve realized that 90 of the challenge here is properly boiling the egg You need to boil it so the center sets yet stays moist You also need to avoid the green grey ring thing that surrounds the yolk in many hard boiled eggs I use the same technique here that I learned camping with a hardcore egg enthusiast It has worked for me flawlessly ever since The key is to avoid over cooking and to dunk the eggs in a bowl of icy water to stop the cooking after you remove them from the hot water I always use good quality eggs but something to keep in mind the fresher they are the harder they are to peel after boiling 6 large eggs1 2 tablespoons mayonnaise or Greek yogurt Salt and pepperA tiny squeeze of lemon juice2 stalks celery washed and chopped1 2 bunch chives chopped2 small handfuls of lettuce8 slices of whole grain bread toasted Place the eggs in a pot and cover with cold water by a 1 2 inch or so Bring to a gentle boil Now turn off the heat cover and let sit for exactly seven minutes Have a big bowl of ice water ready and when the eggs are done cooking place them in the ice bath for three minutes or so long enough to stop the cooking Crack and peel each egg place in a medium mixing bowl Add the mayonnaise a couple generous pinches of salt and pepper now mash with a fork Don t overdo it you want the egg mixture to have some texture If you need to add a bit more mayo to moisten up the mixture a bit go for it a bit at a time Stir in the celery and chives Taste and adjust the seasoning adding more salt and pepper if needed To assemble each egg salad sandwich place a bit of lettuce on a piece of toast top with the egg salad mixture and finish by creating a sandwich with a second piece of toast Make 4 sandwiches Print Recipe the egg salad sandwich recipe i turn to multiple times a week. light on the mayo, with good quality eggs, chopped celery, and a sprinkling of chives on thinly sliced whole grain bread. egg salad sandwich (the only one i'll eat), healthy recipes, natural foods, cookbooks, food blog"",""url"":""101cookbooks

out We become lost to it There are times I try to fight it and times I just let it go Change can be scary I get that but change can also bring us new found passions and joy Now you know why it took me SO long to get a new couch Between my terrible decision making and my husband s lack of enthusiasm for change things can happen s l o w l y around our house In the kitchen I have to play on things I know he likes and see if I can come up with something new that will still grant him that feeling of familiarity Potatoes those are always a win Potatoes are served at almost every meal I get tired of the same ol baked or mashed potatoes but I want something that doesn t take much effort on my part I like to get in and out of the kitchen as quick as I can in the evening Frozen vegetable are a huge timesaver and may be even more healthful than some of the fresh produce sold in supermarkets because they are usually processed at their peak ripeness when they are most nutrient packed I ve recently partnered with ConAgra Foods to talk about the importance of cooking with frozen foods and how they can help save you time in the kitchen They had sent me a box full of frozen goodness that happened to include a bag of Alexia Classic Oven Crinkles French Fries made from ingredients that I recognize These fries are certified organic and contain 3 grams of fiber per serving Perfect for our steak

healthy kids mini muffins quick I got an email from my husband Dave asking if I had time to make some treats for a work meeting he had the next day At this point it was early afternoon and I had to make due with whatever we had in the pantry It just so happened I had some Martha Stewart recipes sitting in my email and this was one of them I made a few changes and here s what I came up with using ingredients on hand Little bites big taste It was time for recipe club again and I wanted to try something new Some friends and were talking about poundcake on Twitter which lead to a search for various poundcake recipes I took some inspiration from a Honey Vanilla Sour Cream Poundcake and a lightened up version of Sour Cream Poundcake with Rum Glaze to come up with my recipe I actually made this recipe twice the full version and a half version because my first cake got stuck in the bundt pan I must say the halved version of the cake was tastier but the first cake made for great strawberry shortcake Two recipes diverged into a sunny kitchen This is the second part of my birthday cake post I was hungry for a Black Forest cake but more specifically chocolate and cherries I thought about making this for Valentine s Day but plans LASIK surgery got in the way So I decided to make this and share with family for our youngest daughter s first birthday The thing I love about black forest cake is the chocolate and the cherries so I wanted to feature those two things in my cake Pie filling meet cake Life s been a little crazy and I haven t been in the kitchen as much as usual So trying to get back on track This is the first installment of a two part post Our youngest just celebrated her first birthday and in keeping with tradition I made her a mini bear cake Since we

many levels First and most importantly the end result is absolutely superior to the commercial brands in both taste and texture I bake my chips with just the thinnest coating of oil so the resulting chip bakes up satisfyingly crisp with a very slight chew and not at all greasy The corn comes through strong and clear not at all like the salt lick flavor of most commercial chips Here s a step by step guide to making these lighter healthier chips at home I that feel a homemade corn chip is a thing apart from what you find in those enormous bags of name brand commercial chips Besides the taste and texture homemade versions are far less oily and salty making them a much healthier choice This is also a good recipe for those of you who aren t interested in taking on the challenges of deep frying All total this recipe takes about 15 20 minutes to assemble and bake I find that my approach to eating these chips is different too Instead of mindlessly shoveling them into my mouth with my homemade chips I m more apt to eat them slowly and their slight chewiness means I pay more attention while I am eating them And because I m preparing them from scratch they re less of an impulse snack and more of a special treat With these chips it s all about the quality of the tortillas I m fortunate to live in an area with a large Latin American population so my chances of scoring amazing grandma made authentic tortillas are very high When I do I always buy extra storing them in the freezer in packs of six That way I can remove what I need and leave them to quickly thaw on my counter Trader Joe s makes a decent truly handmade corn tortilla if that s more convenient for you Homemade chips are also an excellent way to use up slightly stale tortillas How to Make Tortilla Chips in the Oven What You Need IngredientsGood quality corn tortillasNeutral vegetable oil like grapeseed or canolaFlaky sea salt EquipmentBrush for the oilBaking traysCutting boardLarge sharp knife Instructions 1 Preheat oven and oil trays Preheat oven to 350 F Pour a few tablespoons of oil into a bowl and brush a thin coating onto your baking trays Set aside 2 Oil and stack the tortillas Place one tortilla on the cutting board and brush the top with a light layer of oil You don t need a lot of oil but do pay attention to the outer edges of the tortilla an area that s easy to miss Place another tortilla on top of the oiled one and brush the top with oil Continue in this manner until all your tortillas are oiled and stacked in one pile 3 Cut into wedges Using a large sharp knife cut your tortilla stack in half using one firm chop if possible Cut one of the halves in half and cut each of those halves in half again forming wedges Repeat with other side This will give you eight stacks of tortilla wedges 4 Arrange on trays and salt Arrange the tortilla wedges in a single layer on the oiled trays Place the wedges with the un oiled sides facing down so that they have contact with the oil on the try A little overlapping is fine but don t overlap too much or they won t crisp Sprinkle a pinch or two of flaked sea salt over the tops being sure that all of the wedges get a touch of salt 5 Bake for 8 to 12 minutes Place trays in the oven and bake for 8 12 minutes Check your chips at 8 minutes and rotate your pans Be aware that very thin tortillas are vulnerable to your oven s hot spots and can start to char The chips are done when the edges are crisp and dry and slightly lifted from the tray They should be a few shades darker though not completely browned Chips made from handmade tortillas will often have a few brown spots on them so don t worry if you see a few The chips will still be slightly flexible in the middle but will crisp further as they cool 6 Remove and cool Remove trays from the oven and let cool slightly As they cool the chips will continue to crisp all the way through Test one and if it isn t as crisp as you would like return the trays to the oven for another 2 or 3 minutes Once the chips are fairly cool remove them from the tray and serve If you re not eating them right away store in an airtight plastic bag or container Homemade chips are especially susceptible to getting stale so be sure to bag them up as soon as possible Images Dana Velden lately, i've gotten into the habit of making my own corn chips, a process that has proved to be deeply

like other dairy products like yogurt is one of those things that while requiring some demystification and a few special ingredients can be done a lot more easily than you think In the case of mozzarella cheese one of my favorites can be done in less than an hour for the cost of little more than a gallon of milk It s a fun food science experiment one minute you have a pot of milk the next the beginnings of cheese and you get to eat the delicious results Let s get started Supplies Ingredients 1 gallon or larger I used my 6 quart stock pot stainless steel or other non reactive e g non aluminum non cast iron pot with lid dairy thermometer colander slotted spoon long knife rubber gloves optional but recommended cheese cloth optional but also recommended 1 gallon milk not ultra pasteurized If using raw milk and you aren t absolutely positively sure it is free of pathogens heat the milk to 145 degrees Farenheit and keep it there for 30 minutes to pasteurize it If using store bought milk be sure you go with regular pasteurized milk and not ultra pasteurized it ll say on the label as the latter has been heated to a very high temperature that destroys all the organisms you need to make cheese 1 1 4 cup cool chlorine free water If you don t have a water filtration system that removes chlorine for you you can get it at the grocery store 1 1 2 teaspoon citric acid 1 4 teaspoon or 1 4 tablet rennet 1 teaspoon cheese salt or salt substitute Optional but again recommended The last three ingredients can be had from anywhere that sells cheese making supplies I got mine in a kit from cheesemaking com but the ingredients aren t that hard to come by Photo credit Collin Dunn Turning milk to cheese Step 1 Dissolve the rennet in 1 4 cup of the cool chlorine free water stir it up and set it aside Step 2 Mix citric acid into the remaining 1 cup of water and stir until dissolved Step 3 Pour the milk into your pot Stir it continuously while adding the citric acid solution Step 4 Continue stirring the milk over medium heat until it reaches 88 degrees F Step 5 Remove the pot from the heat and slowly stir in the rennet solution stirring up and down for about 30 seconds Step 6 Cover the pot and leave it undisturbed for 5 minutes Photo credit Collin Dunn Curds Whey Step 7 Take off the lid and voila you should have the beginnings of cheese The curd solid will have separated from the whey liquid and the curd should look like custard with a clear separation If the curd is still too soft or milky give it a few more minutes to set If you have something that more closely resembles ricotta cheese you may have stumbled into some ultra pasteurized milk by mistake Time to start over sorry Photo credit Jocelyn Tutak Cutting the cheese Step 8 Cut the curd with the knife be sure that it s long enough to reach the bottom of the pot You want to create little cubes of curd so cut parallel lines about an inch apart at a 45 degree angle Since the goal is creating curd cubes you ll want to make four sets of cuts after the first set of slices rotate the pot 90 degrees and repeat until your one solid curd has been sliced and diced into a bunch of floating cubes Click the photo at left to see what it looks like when you re done Photo credit Jocelyn Tutak Heating the curds Step 9 Put your pot of curds and whey back on the stove and heat to 110 degrees F slowly stirring the curds Once you achieve 110 degrees take the pot off the stove while continuing to stir for another 2 to 5 minutes more time will equal a firmer cheese Photo credit Jocelyn Tutak Separating curds whey Step 10 Ladel the curds into the colander which I lined with some cheesecloth folding gently to help drain off the whey Repeat a couple of times until the curd begins to become more dense and less moist Keep as much of the whey in the pot as you can you ll need it Step 11 Once your curds are more or less one solid mass heat the leftover whey or a different pot of water if you got ahead of yourself and discarded your whey to 185 degrees F Put your curds back in the pot for 5 10 minutes and don your rubber gloves Photo credit Jocelyn Tutak Streching the curds Step 12 Remove the curds from the hot whey and stretch If they don t stretch like taffy and fall apart put them back in their bath they have to be about 135 degrees F to stretch Sprinkle the salt on as you stretch you might get a half dozen or so good pulls on it and continue stretching until it s cool The more you work it the firmer it will be so less stretching will equal a softer cheese I found that stretching roughly half of the curd at a time was a good workable amount Photo credit Jocelyn Tutak Great balls of cheese Step 13 Form your stretched cheese into pleasing shapes I chose balls the little one was the test to see if it was hot enough to stretch If you go with a round shape you can pull the edges up underneath to hide any seams and they ll sort of melt into themselves Other options Braids string cheese rolled logs the options are only bound by your imagination If you aren t ready to eat your new cheese right away give it a bath in ice water to cool it and store it in the refrigerator for two weeks Mine didn t make it that long I sliced it up and made a delicious caprese salad Happy cheese making More on making your ownCaprese Salad made with Home Made Fresh

stress college degree.com | 10 weirdest ways that people manage stress"",""body"":""Published on Wednesday April 13th 2011 Stress is a normal human reaction to life s pressures and challenges We spend most of our lives trying to figure out the best ways to avoid stress and keep it under control with exercise sleep a balanced diet and deep breathing exercises But when those traditional stress relievers no longer work people will find alternative and often unhealthy methods to cope with their stress Here are the 10 weirdest ways that people manage stress Gambling Gambling may seem like a weird way to handle stress but many people find comfort in playing against the odds Those who have an insatiable urge to gamble despite potentially negative consequences are often classified as gambling addicts Gambling provides an adrenaline rush and sense of euphoria when you win therefore someone who is depressed or burdened by a lot of stress might find solace in gambling Self Injury Cutting Some people relieve stress by deliberately hurting themselves This self induced pain is often done by cutting or burning the skin and engaging in dangerous activities People who injure themselves aren t trying to commit suicide but it could be fatal if the injuries are serious enough Self injury is often accompanied by several mental illnesses such as depression bipolar disorder and eating disorders No matter the circumstance deliberately harming oneself is an unhealthy way to cope with stress emotional pain and anger Hoarding Hoarding is a symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder OCD in which individuals collect an excessive amount of items that are generally useless or of little value Hoarding can also involve collecting animals For many individuals hoarding things is a way to relieve stress and overcome other issues Hoarders feel safe and secure when they have their belongings nearby yet it becomes an additional source of stress when it starts to interfere with their safety health and social life Hair Pulling Hair pulling also known as trichotillomania is a disorder that causes people to excessively pull out their hair This irresistible urge to pluck out hair from the scalp eyebrows eyelashes and other parts of the body can be a form of stress relief for certain individuals Although the cause of trichotillomania is not clear it s often associated with genetic and environmental factors or chemical imbalances This disorder is not a normal way of managing stress and should not be taken lightly Vomiting Some people feel a sense of relief to vomit when they re stressed Whether the stress has been brought on by nerves an eating disorder or another form of pressure forcing yourself to vomit is not a healthy way of coping with stress Those who engage in self induced vomiting may feel temporary relief but this disordered behavior may lead to more sever eating disorders malnutrition extreme weight loss and other serious health problems Tattoos Getting tattoos is another odd way that people manage stress Whether it s the touch of the needle immense pain or increase of endorphins to the brain the experience of getting tattoos can be very soothing to stressed individuals Tattooing may also be a less obvious form of self mutilation which can be a cause for concern Overworking It s not uncommon for stressed individuals to try to manage their stress by increasing their workload and working overtime Many people think they can manage their stress and that things will get easier if they just work longer and harder than normal However overworked people may end up making more mistakes and increasing their stress levels because they haven t allowed themselves to relax and get an adequate amount of rest needed to be efficient throughout the day Not Dealing With It at All Many people manage their stress by not dealing with it at all These people turn a blind eye when they are faced with something stressful and put their problems on the back burner hoping their issues will disappear or resolve themselves Others may shut down completely and go into a catatonic state Ignoring stress will only make it worse and could lead to further problems Spending Compulsive shopping and spending is another weird way people manage their stress Treating yourself to a nice bracelet or new pair of shoes may seem innocent enough but this compulsive desire to regularly spend money that you probably don t have can become a very serious problem Compulsive shoppers face several negative consequences such as extreme debt strained relationships ruined credit history anxiety and additional stress Physically Fighting Today more and more people cope with their stress by physically fighting Exercising is simply not enough for these adrenaline junkies who need to let out their aggression on someone else or feel the pain of being hit These people may be hotheads who are always picking fights or an unsuspecting coworker who s a member of an underground fight club No matter their preference fighting is not a normal or healthy way of managing your stress Not only are you inflicting injury on someone else but you too could get severely hurt when traditional stress relievers no longer work, people will find alternative and often unhealthy methods to cope with their stress. when traditional stress relievers no longer work,

arrived in November and got a 750 a month apartment on Madeira Beach Yoder did three condo remodeling jobs in Dunedin before work dried up Not wanting to go into debt he left his apartment and rented a room at the Flamingo Hotel in Clearwater for a week while frantically searching for a job None materialized nor he said did the payment from his last remodeling gig It was mid February and cold when Yoder found himself without a roof I felt ashamed he said It makes you feel shameful that you weren t able to keep your s together Yoder s original thoughts about homeless people have an element of truth Some are mentally ill and substance abusers But an economy that has people talking about the Great Depression has produced more and more Todd Yoders people on the margin who find themselves out on the streets when work gets difficult to find It s just a very sad time in our country said Cliff Smith assistant director of Pinellas County s health and human services department Until this winter Yoder knew nothing about homeless shelters or soup kitchens which he associated with black and white photos from the 1930s He sought out a secluded bank on Stevenson Creek behind the Clearwater Shuffleboard Club where he used the remains of an old tree house to build a shelter The first night he slept on a bed of palm fronds He d come to use their thick bases as a primary fuel source for cooking Knowing that vagrants and strangers are seen as threats he avoided houses while going to and from his camp skirting along the creek bank to get to Edgewater Drive It was the first time in my life that I didn t have any options he said So I started operating in survival mode Under the palm trees mangroves and oaks he worked the creek bank digging in the muck at low tide for oysters and clams I guess I wasn t your normal homeless guy because I was eating oysters on the half shell and steamed clams From a screen door he fashioned a net he used to trap fish that he d lure into the shallows with oysters One afternoon seagulls visited the bank A hot meal Yoder thought The birds appeared to sense the hunter in him and flew off The minute it crossed my mind Hey roasted bird It was like they were psychic He now viewed homelessness from a different perspective which he put into a poem The man who was kingHuddled in the coldWatching the cars go byNot bothering a glance his wayA funny fateFor the man who would be kingHunger gnawsAt his bellyAt his mindHis soul Though prone to dark spells Yoder said he s never been treated for depression By the creek he became consumed by thoughts of suicide The choice was between hanging himself from a tree or jumping from the Sunshine Skyway I was just very despondent he said I felt utterly defeated He battled on going on foot from business to business looking for work To keep presentable and fight the growing stench of his body Yoder took sink baths at nearby Edgewater Park s public restroom The Clearwater Public Library saved him There he found a clean bathroom shelter and Internet service that allowed him to communicate with potential employers his son and his parents He told his family he was doing fine That s just basic pride and shame he said You don t want to admit to the people you care about the most that you ve completely screwed the pooch From the Clearwater library and the one in Dunedin he would get books to distract him and give him an edge Today he almost chuckles as he describes reading a book on how to interview for a job while picking leaves and twigs from his beard He also found other homeless people who told him about programs that could help Yoder discovered Clearwater s Homeless Emergency Project on the library s Internet On March 14 after a month on the creek bank the project s shelter took him in The Department of Veterans Affairs is paying for Yoder s bed at the Homeless Emergency Project through June 16 then he ll need to find other housing Social workers at the project are helping him develop an immediate survival plan Yoder himself is setting longer term goals He hopes to become eligible for VA disability compensation due to his hearing which worsens with time Yoder can t use his back to make a living forever Compensation from the VA could allow him to enroll at St Petersburg College to study sign language interpretation He sees it as a job he can do as he gets older and as a way to help himself as his hearing goes In his journey through the world of the homeless Yoder has been amazed by how many people he s met who are just like him skilled blue collar and suddenly destitute Not mentally unhinged Not addicts They are people he said who have run out of resources Times researcher Carolyn Edds contributed to this report Will Van Sant can be reached at

disorder"",""body"":""NaturalNews In its never ending attempt to fabricate mental disorders out of every human activity the psychiatric industry is now pushing the most ridiculous disease they ve invented yet Healthy eating disorder This is no joke If you focus on eating healthy foods you re mentally diseased and probably need some sort of chemical treatment involving powerful psychotropic drugs The Guardian newspaper reports Fixation with healthy eating can be sign of serious psychological disorder and goes on to claim this disease is called orthorexia nervosa which is basically just Latin for nervous about correct eating But they can t just called it nervous healthy eating disorder because that doesn t sound like they know what they re talking about So they translate it into Latin where it sounds smart even though it isn t That s where most disease names come from Doctors just describe the symptoms they see with a name like osteoporosis which means bones with holes in them Getting back to this fabricated orthorexia disease the Guardian goes on to report Orthorexics commonly have rigid rules around eating Refusing to touch sugar salt caffeine alcohol wheat gluten yeast soya corn and dairy foods is just the start of their diet restrictions Any foods that have come into contact with pesticides herbicides or contain artificial additives are also out Wait a second So attempting to avoid chemicals dairy soy and sugar now makes you a mental health patient Yep According to these experts If you actually take special care to avoid pesticides herbicides and genetically modified ingredients like soy and sugar there s something wrong with you But did you notice that eating junk food is assumed to be normal If you eat processed junk foods laced with synthetic chemicals that s okay with them The mental patients are the ones who choose organic natural foods apparently I told you this was coming Years ago I warned NaturalNews readers that an attempt might soon be under way to outlaw broccoli because of its anti cancer phytonutrients This mental health assault on health conscious consumers is part of that agenda It s an effort to marginalize healthy eaters by declaring them to be mentally unstable and therefore justify carting them off to mental institutions where they will be injected with psychiatric drugs and fed institutional food that s all processed dead and full of toxic chemicals The Guardian even goes to the ridiculous extreme of saying The obsession about which foods are good and which are bad means orthorexics can end up malnourished Follow the non logic on this if you can Eating good foods will cause malnutrition Eating bad foods I suppose is assumed to provide all the nutrients you need That s about as crazy a statement on nutrition as I ve ever read No wonder people are so diseased today The mainstream media is telling them that eating health food is a mental disorder that will cause malnutrition It s just like I reported years ago You re not supposed to question your food folks Sit down shut up dig in and chow down Stop thinking about what you re eating and just do what you re told by the mainstream media and its processed food advertisers Questioning the health properties of your junk food is a mental disorder didn t you know And if you obsess over foods by doing such things as reading the ingredients labels for example then you re weird Maybe even sick That s the message they re broadcasting now Junk food eaters are normal and sane and nourished But health food eaters are diseased abnormal and malnourished But why you ask would they attack healthy eaters People like Dr Gabriel Cousens can tell you why Because increased mental and spiritual awareness is only possible while on a diet of living natural foods Eating junk foods keeps you dumbed down and easy to control you see It literally messes with your mind numbing your senses with MSG aspartame and yeast extract People who subsist on junk foods are docile and quickly lose the ability to think for themselves They go along with whatever they re told by the TV or those in apparent positions of authority never questioning their actions or what s really happening in the world around them In contrast to that people who eat health enhancing natural foods with all the medicinal nutrients still intact begin to awaken their minds and spirits Over time they begin to question the reality around them and they pursue more enlightened explorations of topics like community nature ethics philosophy and the big picture of things that are happening in the world They become aware and can start to see the very fabric of the Matrix so to speak This of course is a huge danger to those who run our consumption based society because consumption depends on ignorance combined with suggestibility For people to keep blindly buying foods medicines health insurance and consumer goods they need to have their higher brain functions switched off Processed junk foods laced with toxic chemicals just happens to achieve that rather nicely Why do you think dead processed foods remain the default meals in public schools hospitals and prisons It s because dead foods turn off higher levels of awareness and keep people focused on whatever distractions you can feed their brains Television violence fear sports sex and so on But living as a zombie is in one way quite normal in society today because so many people are doing it But that doesn t make it normal in my book The real normal is an empowered healthy awakened person nourished with living foods and operating as a sovereign citizen in a free world Eating living foods is like taking the red pill because over time it opens up a whole new perspective on the fabric of reality It sets you free to think for yourself But eating processed junk foods is like taking the blue pill because it keeps you trapped in a fabricated reality where your life experiences are fabricated by consumer product companies who hijack your senses with designer chemicals like MSG that fool your brain into thinking you re eating real food If you want to be alive aware and in control of your own life eat more healthy living foods But don t expect to be popular with mainstream mental health experts or dieticians they re all being programmed to consider you to be crazy because you don t follow their mainstream diets of dead foods laced with synthetic chemicals But you and I know the truth here We are the normal ones The junk food eaters are the real mental patients and the only way to wake them up to the real world is to start feeding them living foods Some people are ready to take the red pill and others aren t All you can do is show them the door They must open it themselves In the mean time try to avoid the mental health agents who are trying to label you as having a mental disorder just because you pay attention to what you put in your body There s nothing wrong with avoiding sugar soy MSG aspartame HFCS and other toxic chemicals in the food supply In fact your very life depends on it Oh and by the way if you want to join the health experts who keep inventing new

children at school She praises them when they answer a question correctly and encourages them when they make mistakes She breaks up scuffles and brings sick tummies to the nurse She writes your child s report cards and meets with you for parent teacher conferences Starting January 1 2010 she took her dedication one step further and began eating the same lunches they eat Why Because someone needs to raise awareness about what exactly American children are being served in the school cafeteria every day Inspired by an unpalatable bagel dog she was forced to munch on when she forgot to pack her own lunch one day the 30 something Mrs Q not her real name made a New Year s resolution to cell phone blog every meal live from Cafeteria A somewhere in the Midwest OK Illinois but she won t get any more specific than that That bagel dog was particularly bad I thought I don t want to eat this I can t believe we expect kids to eat this and then go back to class and focus on what they re teacher is saying In March alone Mrs Q downed 17 school lunches Four pizza slices three burger like meals three chicken entrees two chilis one hot dog one pasta dish one cheese croissant one cheese lasagna and a mac n cheese for good luck all alongside seven fruit cups six servings of carrots two each of pears bananas beans oranges green beans and fruit Jello and a serving each of tater tots they count as a veggie corn broccoli and a fruit icy considered a fruit Her blog Fed Up With Lunch The School Lunch Project has blown up recently thanks to a Good Morning America spot and a bevy of other media interviews her face and voice are always obscured Recent posts include a meatloaf and mystery greens entr\u00e9e that was so malformed she posted a pic and asked her readers to help ID the foods an uber boring Day 55 beige and yellow menu consisting of chicken nuggets carrots a corn muffin fruit Jello and milk I can t remember how this meal tasted Even just a couple hours after I consumed it I have no idea what flavors were present When I ask my students What did you think of your lunch they give me a blank stare Now I get it and a guest post by an American teaching ESL in South Korea who described that school lunches there always include rice soup meat vegetable kimchi and sometimes fruit She graciously agreed to take out from her full time elementary school teaching job blogging and motherhood to speak with Never Say Diet and answer some questions Here are the Qs we asked Mrs Q How are today s school lunches different from what you ate as a child I really can t believe how strange some of these lunches are I wanted to show the world what our kids were eating because these were nothing like what I ate in elementary school We used to have pizza just baked and served off those massive metal sheets or grilled cheese sandwiches my favorite because they came with a bowl of hot tomato soup but what these kids are eating it seems like the quality had gotten worse There s all of this packaging and no cooking really goes on It s all just heated up in large ovens How did we outsource the making of a PB J to a company Why can t we spread the peanut butter on a piece of bread ourselves Why do this now This issue is important now because the Child Nutrition Act is being reauthorized and debated in Congress right now I realize that everyone is strapped for cash right now Individuals companies states and countries are losing money No matter what is going on in this world we can t forget the kids and the fact that many of them are at the mercy of school districts and corporations for their daily meal s It will cost the US more money in the future in the form of healthcare costs if schools don t address the big problem that is staring them in the face every day childhood obesity No matter how great a school is it can t control what the kids eat outside of school But still schools can do better for kids while they are in the building What has been the worst meal you ve tried There were two meals I did not like at all One was a prepackaged peanut butter and jelly on this sort of thick cracker sandwich I actually threw up that night when I got home But that day I d been paranoid about eating so many school lunches so I had taken a vitamin on an empty stomach and that may have done it The other was a lasagna that came in this little container but it didn t have any form It sort of came apart was clumpy That was one of the meals I could barely eat How about any favorites I m really into comfort food and we like to make pasta at home so the pasta dishes have been good for me Even the meaty sauces haven t been too bad Mrs Q doesn t typically eat red meat aside from this project They also have a chili dish that was actually quite good Do you get any fruits and veggies The schools have to offer a cup and a fourth of veggies carrots corns beans peas broccoli They re steamed and sometimes overcooked Tater tots and fries count as a vegetable because they re potatoes And they always have to offer a fruit Unfortunately a fruit cup or a fruit Jello counts as fruit or these icy fruit bars These kids when they get their lunch they just eat that They don t have enough time to focus on all the food and just eat that because it s most appealing Have you noticed any health changes since you started I had cut out a lot of milk from my diet last year because it was causing me a little GI upset I d have some milk with breakfast but that was it With this project I started drinking this whole pint of milk every day and was uncomfortable and made the connection that I m lactose intolerant I had a blood test done in December for health insurance purposes I m going have it redone at the end of the school year As far as weight I was into the project so I was eating all the food Gained a pound that first month but since then have lost 3 pounds So I haven t gained any weight I think the portion control of the lunch is helping it s like a calorie restricted diet I do find myself fading mid to late afternoon at work and I m pretty hungry by 3 30 pm I keep snacks in my car that I nibble on while driving home I eat almonds walnuts and cashews as well as granola bars The nuts give me protein to fill me up and balance out my blood sugar so that I can make it to dinner What do you like to eat when you go out All kinds of Japanese food sushi teriyaki miso soup eel And at home as a working mom I m just doing the best I can to get something healthy on the table Tacos pasta we just had black rice from the Asian food store yesterday fish I don t eat any beef and this project is really beef heavy hamburgers meat pasta sauce Salisbury steak I ve eaten more beef in the past three months than in the past two years Do you remember what you ate in school Was it healthy Do you know what your kids are being served now Chime in below anonymous teacher blogs about the processed junk being served to our kids school lunch, jamie

sleep within 15 minutes you should leave your bedroom and should not return until sleepy The therapy includes maintaining consistent time and using the bedroom only for sleep and sex You should not watch television eat or read the books in the bed Sleep hygiene Maintaining sleep routine that is sleep and wake up times should be same every day engaging in regular exercise workout avoiding naps in

overheated You can add essential oils in water for soothing and relaxation You should not bath close to bed time as it will become harder to sleep because of the elevated body temperatures 5 Diet to promote sleep Your eating patterns also affect the quality of sleep If you take more than 15 minutes to fall asleep you have to change your eating patterns in the evening Alcoholic and caffeinated

to light such as sun light When your circadian rhythm is disturbed your sleep time overlaps with regular activities like going to school or work If your sleep cycle is disturbed your doctor can suggest light therapy as part of treatment plan You are asked to expose to sunlight for specific amount of time If sun light is not available light box is used which provides artificial light Light box contains extremely bright light that should be kept 18 to 24 inches away from you and there is no need to look directly into the light You can just face in the box direction You can do day to day

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rick-foster/no-sugar-diet_b_1397439.html"	"4378"	"{""title"":""Rick Foster My Year off Sugar my year off sugar"",""body"":""One year ago in April 2011 I read an article by Gary Taubes in the New York Times Magazine that scared me straight off sugar And I did it cold turkey Until then I d never dieted in my life In fact I loved every dessert known to humankind With impunity I d scarf the richest cr\u00e8me brulees dulce de leche cakes and fruit pies slathered in whipped cream It was unthinkable to knock back my ritual cups of coffee every morning without brown sugar or a pile of sourdough toast without a thick layer of preserves I loved finishing French meals with the plateaux des deserts or better yet le chariot des deserts that came wheeling up after an already rich meal I remember all these desserts fondly but I haven t had any for a full year When I gave up sugar I wasn t thinking about my weight blood pressure or any of the many unanticipated things that have happened to my body in the past year I stopped eating sugar only because the possible long term metabolic effects of the stuff as discussed in Taubes article were scary enough that I thought I d run an experiment on myself by giving sugar abstinence a shot It s been a year of complete surprises all of which are reported below But there are a few things I should disclose up front First this is a personal account I m not a doctor and I can t suggest that what has happened to me will happen to everyone Second I have no threatening health conditions like diabetes which dictated this choice Third I am an almost non consumer of alcohol which is directly related to sugar consumption for many people so I haven t had to change a drinking pattern And last I m not a purist I know there s sugar in ketchup for instance but I still use it occasionally And even though I read package labels carefully and avoid sugary items in restaurants I know it s used as a flavor enhancer in all kinds of hidden ways I continue to eat out a lot and do the best I can Also to be completely candid I broke the diet twice once to sample a dessert in Korea that I d never seen before and another time when I had dinner at my partner s family reunion and didn t want to make a fuss by turning down cousin Theresa s amazing four hour meringue My painful and instantaneous physical reaction to that tower of meringue was shocking More later So this is a short list of results from my year off sugar The blood tests and hard data I hadn t given much thought to my middle aged paunch but 25 pounds quickly melted away I rarely weigh myself so it wasn t the bathroom scale that tipped me off It was that suddenly my clothes ballooned around me My pants were sagging and my shirts were drooping Now I m down from an XL shirt size to an L and my waist is down three or four inches The weight loss happened in the first five sugar free months and I ve stabilized since then I m enjoying tucking in my shirts The blood work which I had done seven months into the diet was also interesting because I could compare hard results from tests done two years earlier My triglyceride count lowered from 141 a high normal to 117 Glucose levels descended from an above normal 109 to an entirely normal 78 And my blood pressure has gone way down from hovering in the almost hypertensive range of 137 88 to 105 72 Sleep To my amazement on night number two off sugar I slept through the entire night I hadn t had eight hours of continuous sleep since I was a young teenager and couldn t believe that this had anything to do with my new routine But the pattern has maintained This year has been my most restful in the past 50 years The main change is that I can fall back asleep when I wake up at 3 a m This thrills me Energy level I frequently do day long presentations to groups The uncomfortable and precipitous mid afternoon energy drop off has disappeared In fact my energy level stays constant throughout the day and into the evening I ve always had high energy but these days I surprise myself Focus I m aware of being far more able to focus on a task and get it done My tendency toward distraction has reduced dramatically What I would now describe as jittery nervous energy after big doses of sugar through the day has been replaced by a sense of focused calm Cramps A few months into my sugar free life I realized that I hadn t had any leg or foot cramps since the diet began Serious cramping had been a constant problem for years mostly happening suddenly and painfully at night I had no idea how sugar and leg cramps were related so I began to talk about it to the doctors with whom I work About half of them said my cramp less nights were unrelated to sugar intake The other half believe that it is directly related having to do with well regulated glucose levels in the cells of my leg muscles A month after realizing the cramps had disappeared I was confronted by a dessert I couldn t easily refuse Not wanting to seem picky or demanding in front of Greg s relatives whom he hadn t seen in 40 years I knocked back cousin Theresa s mound of whipped cream and berry filled meringue Frankly it was delicious and I was enjoying myself thoroughly until an epic and extremely painful charley horse in my thigh levitated me off my chair It took 25 minutes of limping around in front of the house to ease the cramp It was the last time I knowingly ate sugar If I had previously doubted the impact of sugar all doubts now disappeared The sweetness was simply not worth the pain There have been a couple of other surprises First it s been easy to stay off sugar After a day or two the urge to add sugar disappeared Unsweetened coffee was the biggest challenge but I can now taste the sweetness of milk and the coffee is just fine Also my urge to eat other carbohydrates has been significantly reduced I used to be able to throw down a couple of bowls of pasta at one sitting but now I have trouble finishing one Bread is tasty but I m eating it in smaller quantities My sugar free future looks bright and in fact not a lot has changed I ve always eaten a lot of fruit I love fresh food and have always stayed away from prepared stuff and fast food It has become a lot easier to say no to sugar A lot of people are doing it And the world of desserts is bright too I ve converted what was once a caloric eating experience and one that I enjoyed a lot into an aesthetic experience Early on in this year of sugar abstinence I realized that I had eaten almost every dessert in the world With great detail and delight I can tell you exactly what they taste like Did I really need to consume another chocolate \u00e9clair or slice of tres leches cake or coconut cupcake Really not So now as I sit in restaurants and watch my friends eat those beautiful confections I focus on what they look like on the plate their rich color beautiful design and complex fragrance I enjoy the smiles and sighs of appreciation from my dinner companions And I notice how well I feel and have no intention of ever going back For more by Rick Foster click here For more on diet and nutrition click

"http://homesicktexan.blogspot.com/"	"1730"	"{""title"":""Homesick Texan "",""body"":""Now if you re watching your weight you should stop reading right now as these blue cheese scalloped potatoes with chipotle and bacon are not exactly waistline friendly But believe you me they are luxuriously good The inspiration for these came from a quick trip to Texas last week It had been a few years since I d seen the bluebonnets and when a cheap last minute fare to Austin presented itself to me I immediately booked a flight My vague notion was that I would drive around Central Texas and would be blown away by all the wildflowers The reality however was a bit less spectacular as the weather had been dry and not many flowers had popped out of the ground just yet As I spoke to people in the various small towns I visited I heard that the best bluebonnets were to be found in North Texas with an exceptionally fine showing in Ennis So even though my plan had been to spend my brief time in Texas in the Hill Country I changed course and headed north After a night s rest I woke up before dawn and drove to Ennis arriving just as the sun was rising I d found a map of the bluebonnet trail and began to make my way to the areas marked as being especially lush The reports did not lie I d never seen such a spectacular showing of bluebonnets Narrow winding roads curved around farms with rolling hills and pastures blanketed in blue I don t know if the area s farmers plant seeds or if these bluebonnets are wild but the display was breathtaking At one point I stepped out of the car and could see nothing but fields and flowers for miles and miles Save for an occasional house or cow there were no other signs of civilization I felt like the pioneers must have felt when the first saw Texas in all of its wild unfettered glory Before heading back to Austin for my flight home I stopped at a small town caf\u00e9 the kind of place where the walls are covered in football uniforms and the waitress greets you with a hearty Hey Hon On the board cream potatoes were listed as one of the vegetables of the day I ordered them thinking that the potatoes would be sliced potatoes baked in a creamy sauce But instead they were just mashed potatoes though very good mashed potatoes as they were full of lovable lumps which told me they were made from scratch But you know when an idea gets into head and you can t shake it out Well that s how it was with the potatoes I suddenly had a crazy craving for scalloped potatoes So when I returned to New York my first order of business was to at last make the creamy potatoes that I had hoped to eat in Texas In my fridge I had some blue cheese so I added that to the potatoes And as I always have bacon and chipotle chiles I also threw them in as I figured they d play well with the other ingredients It took a couple of tries to get this right I don t recommend putting heavy cream in a blender with garlic and chipotle chiles unless you want to make chipotle garlic butter but once I figured it out I was extremely satisfied As I said earlier this is a dish that is probably best saved for special occasions such as Easter or other family gatherings That said it takes little time to prepare and if you re looking to live a little large you can t go wrong with these potatoes made just a little fancier with blue cheese chipotle and cream Blue cheese scalloped potatoes with chipotle and baconIngredients 1 teaspoon vegetable oil1 2 cup half and half or whole milk4 ounces blue cheese crumbled and divided2 cloves garlic chopped1 canned chipotle chilePinch of nutmeg2 1 2 cups heavy cream2 pounds russet potatoes peeled and cut into 1 8 inch round slicesSalt and black pepper to taste8 ounces sharp white cheddar shredded4 slices cooked bacon crumbledMethod Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Lightly grease a 10 inch ovenproof skillet such as cast iron with the oil Pour the half and half into a blender and add half of the blue cheese the garlic chipotle chile and nutmeg Blend until smooth Pour the blender contents into a bowl Add the heavy cream and whisk the two together Arrange half the sliced potatoes on the bottom of the skillet Lightly season the potatoes with salt and black pepper Pour half of the cream mixture over the potatoes Top with half of the remaining blue cheese crumbles Layer on top the remaining potato slices Lightly season the potatoes with salt and black pepper Pour the rest of the thickened cream mixture on top and top with the rest of the blue cheese Cover the skillet with foil and bake for 40 minutes Remove the skillet from the oven take off the foil and arrange on top the shredded cheddar and the crumbled bacon Bake for 20 more minutes uncovered or until brown and bubbling and the potatoes are soft Yield 8 servingsNote I like a lot of cheese but feel free to cut back if you prefer Keep reading a texan in new york city celebrates texas home cooking through stories, recipes, photographs and

cavesExperts warn in the wrong hands could bring Western cities to their knees By Ben Ellery PUBLISHED 17 01 EST 1 December 2012 UPDATED 17 01 EST 1 December 2012 Down the years and across the universe the heroes of science fiction classics from Dan Dare to Star Wars and The Matrix have fought intergalactic battles with weapons that wipe out enemy electronics at the touch of a button Now scientists have turned fantasy into reality by developing a missile that targets buildings with microwaves that disable computers but don t harm people Aircraft manufacturer Boeing successfully tested the weapon on a one hour flight during which it knocked out the computers of an entire military compound in the Utah desert Pre programmed filghtpath Aircraft manufacturer Boeing has successfully tested a missile which knocked out an entire military compound in the Utah desert It is thought the missile could penetrate the bunkers and caves believed to be hiding Iran s suspected nuclear facilities But experts have warned that in the wrong hands the technology could be used to bring Western cities such as London to their knees During Boeing s experiment the missile flew low over the Utah Test and Training Range discharging electromagnetic pulses on to seven targets permanently shutting down their electronics Boeing said that the test was so successful even the camera recording it was disabled Codenamed the Counter Electronics High Power Microwave Advanced Missile Project CHAMP it is the first time a missile with electromagnetic pulse capability has been tested For security reasons Boeing declined to release film of the test but instead issued an artist s impression of it on video In the clip a stealth aircraft deploys a missile that emits radio waves from its undercarriage which knock out the computer systems inside the buildings below Stealth mission The missile is launched from a stealth bomber and is thought to be able to penetrate the bunkers and caves believe to be hiding Iran s suspected nuclear facilities The company did release real film showing a row of computers that can be seen shutting down when the electromagnetic pulse is switched on Although the project is shrouded in secrecy experts believe the missile is equipped with an electromagnetic pulse cannon This uses a super powerful microwave oven to generate a concentrated beam of energy which causes voltage surges in electronic equipment rendering them useless before surge protectors have the chance to react Keith Coleman CHAMP programme manager for Boeing s prototype arm Phantom Works said the technology marked a new era in modern warfare He added In the near future this technology may be used to render an enemy s electronic and data systems useless even before the first troops or aircraft arrive We hit every target we wanted and made science fiction into science fact When the computers went out it actually took out the cameras as well It was fantastic The project has cost 24 million and has been developed on behalf of the US Air Force Research Laboratory following a request from the Pentagon four years ago Lead test engineer Peter Finlay said We re not quite at the place where the Star Trek and Star Wars movies are but this is definitely an advancement in technology able to give us an opportunity to do things we could not do before James Dodd vice president of Advanced Boeing Military Aircraft said there was a real need for a weapon that could knock out a target but not cause harm to people and structures He said We know this has capabilities and impact We re trying to see if we can get it implemented sooner rather than later However experts fear that the project could create an arms race with countries scrambling to build their own electromagnetic pulse weapons Wiped out Boeing s film shows computers before left and after right the attack by the drone but experts have warned that in the wrong hands the technology could be used to bring Western cities such as London to their kneesProfessor Trevor Taylor Professorial Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute said the Western world would be much more vulnerable to such an attack because of our increased reliance on electronics He added This is a challenging area in political and military terms Ideally there would have been an arms control agreement to cover this field because once technology is actually developed control becomes harder The historical record shows that important technologies developed in one country are developed elsewhere within a relatively short period look what happened with regard to the USSR and nuclear weapons Should the US be known to have developed such a technology to the production stage it would drive others to try to act similarly Western countries are more dependent on electronics based IT than others and would be vulnerable to extensive disruption aircraft manufacturer boeing has created a weapon that can knock out computers

in 2010 he did so against a backdrop of uncertainty Its arrival came with the typical predictable fanfare Apple devotees queued around the block to get their hands on it while technology blogs and news websites including this one prodded excitedly at it Is this the future of computing everyone wondered Back then nobody really knew the answer It was a mood best summed up by a simple remark from BBC website reader Ian Mears I must admit I want one he wrote But I don t know what I d actually do with it Yet the numbers do not lie Two years and over 50 million units later Apple can rightly claim to be king of the tablet market But as Apple chief executive Tim Cook launched the new iPad he did so facing a different kind of uncertainty Less cool Today s doubts centre on whether the Apple s device can remain at the top of the tablet tree Judging by the reaction of the technology watchers at the London media event Apple has done just enough for now I think they ve done a good job to give first generation iPad owners a reason to upgrade says Carolina Milanesi lead Apple analyst for Gartner And also to all the people who felt a little less cool now than they did an hour and a half ago That s what Apple does Aside from the unsurprising addition of the retina high quality display of particular interest was the addition of 4G LTE technology a method of receiving data far faster than the iPad s existing 3G capabilities But for buyers in the UK this speed boost remains out of reach The country s telecoms regulator Ofcom is still planning a 4G mobile spectrum auction By the time the networks roll out next year the next iPad may have been unveiled Despite the frustrations this may cause to some UK owners Ms Milanesi predicts that it will not prove too damaging to sales If it was at a higher price people might have said why bother she says Most people will still use their own wi fi and although we re not going to see LTE they have optimised HSDPA an enhanced 3G protocol So even to a UK consumer it should see some improvement Slamming Samsung At present most of the iPad s competitors come in the form of Google Android powered devices mainly from Samsung and Motorola Mr Cook attempted to deal with this head on with a cockiness designed to delight the Apple watchers in attendance while also antagonising the creators and perhaps the owners of the Samsung Galaxy Tab Reeling through apps such as Twitter on the Samsung device Mr Cook claimed to have demonstrated the inferiority of his rival It is no coincidence some would say that this show of bravado comes at a time when Apple and Samsung remain locked in ongoing patent legal battles Nevertheless even one of Samsung s product strategy managers recently admitted honestly we re not doing very well in the tablet market according to a recent Cnet report Even so experts are keeping a close eye on the Galaxy Note which is sized somewhere between a tablet and a smartphone The firm has already shipped more than two million units While not all of those will equate to sales the figure is considerably better than some doubters predicted The South Korean firm is targeting 10 million shipments by the end of the year But turning back to tablets one company that may pose more of a challenge is Apple s long time rival Microsoft The firm enjoyed a high profile and well received launch for the preview of its Windows 8 operating system last week The system will offer users the same functionality on their PC and tablets Come Christmas time the big battle in the consumer space will be Microsoft versus Apple with Google pushed to the side predicts Stuart Miles of Pocket lint Gartner s Ms Milanesi agrees saying that the multi platform Windows 8 operating system will have Apple looking over its shoulder I do think that overall Microsoft is going to be a more serious contender than Android simply because I still don t understand what Google wants to achieve Their focus around revenue coming from advertising takes them away from caring about the device the experience and what comes with it Amazon s appeal However it may be too early to write Android s prospects off The operating system already accounts for nearly 50 of the US smartphone market according to a recent study by Comscore Time magazine and Wired have reported rumours that a Google branded seven inch tablet may launch later this year running the new Ice Cream Sandwich version of the software and undercutting the iPad in price offering the firm a fresh opportunity to appeal to owners of phones using its system Amazon s Kindle Fire appears to have proved that there is an appetite for a budget priced tablet The firm has not released detailed sales figures but analysts at iSuppli have estimated that it shipped 3 9 million devices in the US over the last quarter of 2011 accounting for a 14 3 share of the market If accurate that would make it the sector s second biggest player behind Apple Whether it will prove vulnerable to the discounted iPad 2 which remains on sale remains to be seen Blackberry s struggle The most exposed company may prove to be Canada s Research in Motion RIM The firm recently released version 2 0 of its Blackberry Playbook software providing fully functional email contacts and calendar apps that its tablet previously lacked It also offers users the opportunity to run Android software radically extending the amount of programs available But some analysts fear the company may still struggle to ignite interest and predict more bad news when it releases its next results on 29 March Apple may sell more of the new iPads in two days than RIM will have sold Playbooks over the whole of its fourth quarter says Colin Gillis senior technology analyst at BGC Partners in New York It s possible that the firm may have even had more returns than sales They lost the high end to Apple the low end is owned by Amazon and the enterprise market will soon be owned by Microsoft with Windows

Best Taunting Moments in Sports the best taunting moments in sports"",""body"":""All the talk in sports these days is about decorum respect and cleaning up the game Have you seen the NFL s new regulations for on field antics But let s be honest Taunting is one of the great things about sports Many of the great moments we remember from Jordan s tongue wag to Muhammad Ali standing menacingly over Liston were pure taunts Here are the greatest taunts in sports history No 20 Sean Avery Mocks Maxime Talbot Hockey players like being seen as tough guys and getting into big fights on the ice So what could be worse for Talbot than listening to iconoclast Sean Avery mock his punches No 19 Terrell Owens Mocks Ray Lewis Ray Lewis dance was among both the most feared and ridiculous antics on the gridiron It s funny that the NFL s most flamboyant wide receiver was the only man with the guts to mock it No 18 Roy Jones Jr Mocks Glen Kelly In his heyday Roy Jones was the world s best boxer and head and shoulders better than anyone in his weight class He was so good that he actually put his hands behind his back to taunt Glen Kelly and then he knocked him out for good measure No 17 Philip Rivers Taunts Jay Cutler Once upon a time Jay Cutler was Philip Rivers West Coast rival The two star quarterbacks hated one another So when the Broncos were down 23 3 in their 2007 AFC West battle Rivers decided to wave goodbye just to rub the loss in a little bit deeper No 16 Joe Namath Calls the Score Is it a taunt to call the score before the Super Bowl Who knows but the iconic Namath did it against the Baltimore Colts and when he got it right he secured his place in the NFL s Hall of Fame No 15 Albert Belle Threatens Kevin Kennedy Belle no stranger to controversy didn t take kindly to Boston manager Kevin Kennedy s claims that he used a corked bat Flashing his bicep threateningly at Kennedy he said There s your cork No 14 Terrell Owens Attacks the Dallas Star The Cowboys star is one of the most sacred symbols in Texas Owens repeatedly disrespected it in this 2000 game as a 49er and he made an enemy of Cowboys fans for years Ironically Owens joined Dallas years later and put up some of the best numbers of his career representing the star No 13 Reggie Bush vs the Bears Defense Down 16 7 against Chicago Reggie Bush caught a pass from Drew Brees and used his electric speed to outrun the entire Bears defense The funniest part He managed to point at them the entire last 15 yards to his touchdown Still the Bears had the last laugh defeating the Saints to advance to the 2006 Super Bowl in Miami No 12 Randy Moss Moons Green Bay Fans Randy Moss is one of the all time maverick personalities in NFL history Who else would moon opposing fans in the 2004 NFC Wild Card Game No 11 Boston Fans Taunt Darryl Strawberry Boston fans were desperate to win the 1986 World Series and they pulled out all the stops In fact they were so harsh that they inspired a Simpsons parody No 10 Babe Ruth Calls His Home Run Did the Babe actually do it It doesn t matter The fact that people believe Ruth declared he would hit a home run to center field during the World Series then actually did it says everything you need to know about one of baseball s most historic players No 9 Yankees Fans Taunt Pedro Martinez Pedro Martinez delivered an assist to the Yankees when he said They beat me they re that good right now I just tip my hat and call the Yankees my daddy The Yankees responded with Who s your daddy Who s your daddy It was certainly a far cry from Pedro s manhandling dominance of the Yankees in his golden years from 1997 2000 No 8 Scottie Pippen Dunks on Ewing Scottie gets credit for a two for one Not only did he dunk on New York Knicks star Patrick Ewing embarrassing him he also taunted uber fan Spike Lee and put him in his place It s exactly what the Chicago Bulls did to New York for most of the 1990s No 7 Donald Sterling Taunts His Own Player Phil Jackson discussing Sterling s karma Only the Donald the one without the world famous hair would actually taunt his own star player on the court Sure Davis was wasting 13 million of Sterling s money per year but would taunting from your own owner motivate you to play better No 6 Michael Jordan Finger Wags Dikembe Mutombo Watch the wag at 1 20 Mutombo s finger wag is one of the best taunts of all time Jordan who loved to humiliate his opponents couldn t resist turning it right back on Mutombo No 5 Reggie Miller Chokes Spike Lee In the mid 1990s the greatest rivalry wasn t between players It was between one visiting player Reggie Miller and filmmaker Spike Lee No 4 Manny Pacquiao s Mini Concert What s the best way to say You didn t hurt me to your opponent Participate in a concert after the fight How do you feel about that Miguel Cotto No 3 Dikembe Mutombo s Finger Wag The big man s finger wag would have gotten old except that he was just so good at blocking shots How could his rejection notice get old while he was establishing himself as one of the most dominant shot blockers in NBA history No 2 Michael Jordan s Tongue Michael Jordan was a killer on the court He didn t just want to beat opponents he wanted to humiliate them The tongue wag was the perfect way for Jordan to show his attitude and style No 1 Muhammad Ali over Sonny Liston Muhammad Ali was the most brash confident talented heavyweight boxer in history And in that moment when he stood over Liston snarling menacingly it was like taunting I have arrived rankings\/list, multiple sports, b\/r swagger, cool lists all the talk in sports these days is about decorum, respect and cleaning up the game. have you seen the nfl's new regulations for on-field antics? but let's be honest: taunting is one of the great things

\""last meal ribs,\"" the best barbecue ribs you've ever tasted on labor day, make \""last meal ribs,\"" the best barbecue ribs you've ever tasted"",""body"":""Here s how to make low and slow smoke roasted Last Meal Ribs on just about any covered grill and make slabs better than they do in restaurants You ll never boil ribs again That s because water is a solvent and it pulls much of the flavor out of the meat When you boil meat you make soup You wouldn t boil a steak would you If you boil ribs the terrorists win There s nothing revolutionary in this method Envision a proto human tribe padding warily through the fragrant ashes of a forest fire as they follow a particularly seductive scent When they stumble upon the charred carcass of a wild boar they squat and poke their fingers into its side They sniff their hands then lick their greasy digits The magical blend of warm protein molten fat and unctuous collagen in the roasted meat is a narcotic elixir and it addicts them on first bite They become focused obsessed with tugging out the rib bones and scraping them clean between their teeth moaning and shaking their heads The aromas make their nostrils smile and the flavors cause their mouths to weep They sing praises to their gods Now imagine your tribe your family and friends moaning in ecstasy and praising your name in your own backyard You can make it happen if you follow my step by step guide below I share this with you after years of studying at the feet of the masters judging at barbecue competitions including the Jack Daniel s World Championship International Barbecue and sucking on a lot of bones We re talking Southern ribs here a style created by African slaves and as uniquely American as their other great contributions to our culture Jazz and the blues The ribs that win championships are a melange of flavors Spice rub hardwood smoke tangy sweet sauce all underpinned by the distinct flavor of pork They are juicy and tender and they tug cleanly off the bone They do not fall off the bone They have the texture of other properly cooked meats like steaks Click here to see what I look for when I judge rib cookoff what I consider to be Amazing Ribs There may be a few more steps in this process than you like but it s not hard and we re talking blue ribbon competition grade meat here If you love ribs follow these steps and you will thank me as so many others have Serves 2 adults Preparation time Overnight dry rub marinating is optional Cooking time We will be cooking low and slow so allow 5 hours for St Louis Cut ribs my faves and 3 hours for baby back ribs Hardware 1 grill with a cover You can use a dedicated smoker or any charcoal grill or gas grill as long as it has a cover A tight fitting cover with adjustable vents like those on the Weber Kettle is best 1 18 pound bag of charcoal for charcoal grills or smokers You won t use all that charcoal but because you will need more on cold windy or wet days than on sunny and warm days have a full bag on hand Hardwood lump is best but regular briquets will do fine Absolutely do not use the instant igniting stuff that has solvent in it Chimney starters are by far the best way to start charcoal especially for long slow cooking where the smell of the solvent in charcoal starter fluid can ruin the taste of the meat 1 tank of propane for gas cookers You won t need it all but until you get the hang of this technique don t risk running out by starting with a partial tank 8 ounces by weight of hardwood chunks chips or pellets It doesn t matter how many slabs you are cooking 8 ounces should be enough I prefer chunks of apple oak or hickory for pork Never use any kind of pine unless you want meat that tastes like turpentine Never use construction lumber because it is often treated with poisonous chemicals to discourage rot and termites You do not need to soak the wood Wood does not absorb much water That s why they make boats with it 1 pair of long handled tongs 1 sauce brush preferably one of those newfangled silicon brushes 12 feet of heavy duty aluminum foil not the lightweight stuff 1 good instant read thermometer preferably digital 1 six pack of beer for the cook not the meat 1 lawn chair 1 good book Tunes Software 1 slab of fresh St Louis Cut SLC ribs That s 1 2 slab per adult If you use baby back ribs get a whole slab per person You may have leftovers but what s wrong with that SLCs are the meatiest and most flavorful ribs They are spare ribs with the tips removed so they form a nice rectangular rack You can use baby back ribs if you prefer They are smaller and cook faster Country ribs come from the shoulder and are not really ribs so don t use them for this recipe Get fresh not frozen meat if possible Fresh meat has the best pork flavor and the most moisture Ever notice the pink liquid when you defrost meat You can t get that back into the meat so buy fresh meat whenever possible Ask the butcher to remove the membrane on the back side 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 4 tablespoons of Meathead s Memphis Dust or a similar spice rub 1 cup apple juice 1 cup of your signature homemade barbecue sauce or a good commercial barbecue sauce Do this 1 Rinse Rinse the ribs in cool water to remove any bone bits from the butchering and any bacterial film that grew in the package don t worry cooking will sterilize the meat Pat dry with paper towels 2 Skin n trim If the butcher has not removed the membrane from the back side do it yourself Insert a butter knife under the membrane then your fingers shown at right work a section loose grip it with a paper towel and peel it off Finally trim the excess fat from both sides Click here to see more photos of how to skin n trim 3 Rub Coat the meat with a thin layer of cooking oil Sprinkle enough Meathead s Memphis Dust to coat all surfaces but not so much that the meat doesn t show through That is about 2 tablespoons per side depending on the size of the slab Many of the herbs and spices in the rub are oil soluble so the cooking oil will help them penetrate a little better Spread the Memphis Dust on the meat and rub it in Wash your hands Wrap the meat in half the foil and let it sit in the fridge for at least 4 hours on a platter or pan to catch leaks In addition to flavoring the meat the salt in the rub pulls the juices to the surface and that will help form a crust during the cooking If you don t have time to let the meat marinate in the dry rub it s not the end of the world Put on the oil and rub anyway and start cooking 4 Setup for indirect 2 zone cooking That means that one side is hot and the other is not If you have a gas grill use only one burner as described in my article setup for a gas grill Put a disposable aluminum pan with water on top of the hot burner Moisture and combustion gasses in a propane grill combine to create a seductive baconlike flavor in the meat If it has only one burner put the water pan between the meat and the burner If you have a charcoal grill push the coals to one side as in the photo at right and as described in best setup for a charcoal grill You can use a water pan but it is not necessary If you have an offset firebox smoker follow my instructions for an setting up an offset smoker If you have a bullet smoker like the Weber Smokey Mountain read my article bullet smoker setup 5 Adjust the temp Preheat your cooker to about 225F and try to keep it there throughout the cook Adjust the air intake dampers at the bottom to control heat on charcoal grills Intake dampers are more effective than exhaust dampers for controlling the temp because they reduce the supply of oxygen to the coals Take your time getting the temp right Cooking at 225F will allow the meat to roast low and slow liquefying the collagen in connective tissues and melting fats without getting the proteins knotted in a bunch It s a magic temp that creates silky texture adds moisture and keeps the meat tender If you can t hit 225F get as close as you can Don t go under 200F and try not to go over 250F Click here for more about meat science and the thermodynamics of cooking 6 Smoke For charcoal or gas cookers add 4 ounces of wood at this time Put the wood right on top of the flame of a gas grill or on the hot coals Resist the temptation to add more wood Nothing will ruin a meal faster and waste money better than oversmoked meat You can always add more the next time you cook but you cannot take it away if you oversmoke 7 Relax Put the slabs in the cooker on the cooler side of the grill meaty side up Close the lid and go drink a beer and read a book 8 More smoke When the smoke disappears after 20 30 minutes add another 2 ounces of wood After the first hour stop adding wood Adding wood at the beginning of the cook allows better penetration before the meat surface seals itself If you have more than one slab on halfway through the cook you will need to move the ribs closest to the fire away from the heat and the slabs far from the flame in closer Leave the meat side up There is no need to flip the slabs Otherwise keep your lid on Opening the lid just upsets the delicate balance of heat moisture and oxygen inside your cooker It can also significantly lengthen the cooking time No peeking If you re lookin you ain t cookin 9 The Texas Crutch Now we employ another secret of the champions The Texas Crutch After 3 hours of cooking St Louis Cut ribs at 225F 1 1 2 hours for baby backs take 6 of heavy duty foil and fold it into a 3 length Lay the slab on the foil meaty side up Fold up the sides making a boat and pour 1 cup of apple juice into the boat Don t pour it on the meat or you ll wash off the rub Now carefully fold the foil around the meat sealing it tight and trying hard not to puncture the foil Be careful those bones can poke through Put the packet back on the grill for 30 60 minutes No more than 60 minutes By creating a little steam The Texas Crutch adds flavor moisture tenderness and finishes cooking the meat If you want to skip this step feel free you ll still have killer ribs 10 Sauce Now take the meat out of the foil being careful not to curl your eyebrows with the steam when you open the packet and place the ribs back on at 225F for another hour to firm up the surface Then paint both sides with your favorite home made barbecue sauce or storebought sauce and move them directly over the hottest part of the grill in order to caramelize and crisp the sauce On a charcoal grill just move the slab over the coals On a gas grill crank up all the burners On a water smoker remove the water pan and move the meat close to the coals On an offset smoker put a grate over the coals in the firebox and put the meat there With the lid open so you don t roast the meat from above sizzle the sauce on one side and then the other One coat of a thick sauce should be enough but if you need two go ahead but no more Don t hide all the fabulous flavors under too much sauce If you think you ll want more sauce put some in a bowl on the table If you ve done all this right you will notice that there is a thin pink layer beneath the surface of the meat This does not mean it is undercooked It is the highly prized smoke ring caused by the combustion gases and the smoke It is a sign of Amazing Ribs Now be ready to take a bow when the applause swells from the audience Optional Instead of using barbecue sauce make Vermont Pig Candy shown at the top of this page This is always a huge hit Here s a summary of the process Pour the apple juice from the foil into a sauce pan and mix it with 1 4 cup of real maple syrup not artificially flavored pancake syrup and cook it about 15 minutes on medium high heat or until it starts to foam Watch it carefully and take it off the moment it foams Then add 2 pinches of salt and 2 teaspoons of hot sauce more or less Paint this wonderful glaze on the meat and put it back on the grill over high heat with the lid open and watch it carefully because it can burn easily The moment it begins to sizzle and bubble turn it and sizzle it on the other side Serve it and wait for the compliments Serve with Bourbon Baked BeansCreamy Deli Slaw or Sweet Sour

peanut butter it can be substituted with sunbutter or soy nut butter to comply with peanut free school regulations or to ease hunger pangs in peanut sensitive tummies Popcorn Popcorn can be a very healthy snack but the microwave variety has been linked to a shocking number of dangerous potentially carcinogenic chemicals For all of the convenience of microwaved popcorn with none of the oils chemicals and additives simply toss a \u00bd cup of regular popcorn kernels in a no frills brown lunch bag and microwave until popping slows to two seconds Roasted Kale Even kids that snub all forms of leafy green produce will flip for roasted kale which gives potato chips a run for their flavorful money and contain none of the questionable ingredients Just remove the veins from kale leaves and toss them in a scant amount of olive oil Roast at 400 for roughly five minutes turn and continue roasting for another 7 to 10 Pull them out of the oven before they start to turn brown and sprinkle with a little bit of sea salt You ll be surprised at how difficult it is to keep a supply of roasted kale when your little ones discover how tasty it is Dried Fruit Sulphur dioxide a sulphite preservative has been linked to health concerns and is often present in large amounts in commercially processed dried fruit The World Health Organization recommends that sulphite preservatives be avoided or phased out whenever possible To keep sulphite preservatives out of your kids dried fruit it might be wise to invest in a relatively inexpensive food dehydrator The investment is a sound one if your kids are big dried fruit fans as it will allow you to dry a variety of fresh produce and serve it with no traces of sulphur dioxide Homemade Trail Mix Tossing your homemade dried fruit with a selection of organically harvested nuts and other goodies to make a healthy additive free trail mix is a great option for kids that have no known sensitivities to nuts just be sure that your child s school doesn t restrict tree nuts as a matter of policy Keeping your kids healthy and their diet free of potentially dangerous chemicals can be easier than you realize it simply requires an investment of time Experiment with healthy unprocessed snacks to find others that everyone in your family will love and kick the processed habit for good "",""url"":""findababysitter org blog 10 alternative to

kitchen every evening Sometimes I just pop a bowl of cold fried rice into the microwave for a quicker than quick dinner On Tuesdays my mother and I steam broccoli chop watermelon into chunks sit down to watch Chopped and call it a night I ve even leaned against the fridge and eaten cold chicken salad straight out of the tupperware Our kitchen is always stocked with enough leftovers to make us low maintenance weeknight diners Weekends though That s an entirely different matter Sometimes the whole day revolves our food My mother often wakes up before me to brush her bread with an egg glaze and we juggle the oven so I can bake biscuits She s the queen of scrambled eggs and freshly squeezed juice and I can press any berry into a special maple syrup My parents and I frequently head to the farmer s market right after breakfast to shop for dinner usually without a meal plan in mind We pick whatever s fresh and seasonal and bright whatever inspires hunger even though we just ate My family has been known to spend an afternoon rolling out pasta directly on our dinner table marinating fish picking through sun warmed herbs Then we feast Don t be fooled though There are plenty of awful mistakes pain in the rear ingredients and even the occasional temper Our kitchen is what my dad likes to call a two butt work area The three of us barely fit inside it and with the two dogs brushing against our ankles it s a very tight squeeze Usually it s chaotic frustration As the sky darkens my dad works from both the stove and the cutting board on opposite ends of the kitchen My mother can t help but clean dishes in real time sometimes whisking bowls off into the sink before we re through with them And me I m just trying to get to the oven which is between the two of them Add Tilly who begs at your feet until you step on her and Otis who grunts whenever you drop a scrap it s an experience Yet once we carry plates to the table settling down in our usual chairs it s calm It s relaxed It s all about passing plates and trying a bit of everything It s the subdued Mmm at first bite Cooking together is hectic but it s always worth it There is something intangible about a meal created with your family an hour of satisfaction and a lifetime of memories Usually when I m in the kitchen I m alone Sometimes I m even the only one in the entire house especially now in the summer I love baking in the serene calm of morning with light streaming from the window above the sink and the French doors It s quiet except for blue jays rustling in the backyard pines and the faint rhythm of my breath It s silent enough for me to sense the song of the kitchen in my ears and in my soul When I m baking by myself the kitchen is perfect for one person spacious even I can t help but feel that there s no better way to spend life than alone with my thoughts and my Kitchen Aid That is until the weekend rolls around again Then I m weaving between my parents half laughing and half exasperated five minutes away from dinner s ready And at that moment there s no other place I d rather be They re opposite situations and I like that I like the contrast and the fact that such distinct experiences can occur in the same room The differences make each experience memorable and sweet even if they don t seem to complement each other at first glance I love juxtaposed differences in life and in food Sweet with salty hot with cool creamy with crunchy Enter these watermelon bars the perfect example of just that The bottom layer is the simplest watermelon sorbet a snap to whirl together It freezes somewhat hard and icy but it s utterly refreshing The sorbet is spread with a basil lime semifreddo which is one of the most delicious things I ve ever made The semifreddo makes up for all the richness the sorbet lacks whisked with sweetened condensed milk and lightened with whipped cream It s so thick and creamy it should be illegal The zing of lime and smooth floral aroma of basil pair gorgeously with melon It could be a clash of flavors and textures but I think they make a beautifully balanced combination Together they pack the epitome of summer in every melting bite I d had these chilled bars in the back of my mind since I first saw them in Gourmet magazine two years ago I finally froze a batch because I had a hunk of watermelon in the fridge and a bag of limes perfuming the counter I threw in basil my favorite herb since it reminds me of everything summer My dad didn t like the bars as much as I did but only because he felt the two frozen desserts could be paired differently He suggested multiple thinner layers of sorbet and semifreddo for a multi layered bar or perhaps for a swirled scoop of ice cream Both great potential variations on this dessert The flavors in the bars are very bold especially the citrus Don t be afraid If you know you re not a fan leave out the lime zest in the semifreddo I liked everything as is Frozen Watermelon Basil Lime

limeJuice of two small limes1 2 cup heavy whipping cream chilled Line the bottom and sides of a 9 x9 pan with plastic wrap so that there is some overhang on all four sides I used aluminum foil but I wouldn t recommend it It flaked later on when I cut the bars Place the lined pan in the freezer while making the watermelon sorbet To make the sorbet blend the watermelon in a blender or food processor until smooth Add the sugar Grand Marnier and lemon juice and blend until very smooth Chill the mixture in the freezer for 30 minutes or until very cold then churn in an ice cream maker Spread the churned sorbet in the prepared pan and freeze at least 2 hours or until the sorbet has hardened To make the semifreddo heat the sweetened condensed milk with the basil in a small saucepan over medium heat until it steams Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature When cool whisk in the zest and lime juice until smooth In another bowl whisk the whipping cream until it just reaches stiff peaks Fold it into the sweetened condensed milk gently with a rubber spatula Smooth over the watermelon sorbet in the 9 x9 pan and freeze until solid preferably overnight I also recommend putting plates in the freezer at this point so when you re ready to serve the bars you can use chilled plates and the bars won t melt as quickly When ready to serve use the overhanging

authority - john w. rowe - health - the atlantic why nurses need more authority"",""body"":""Allowing nurses to act as primary care providers will increase coverage and lower health care costs So why is there so much opposition from physicians Reuters Think it takes a long time to get an appointment with a primary care provider now Brace yourself it will likely only get worse We re facing a severe shortage of primary care physicians in the nation The Association of American Medical Colleges predicts a shortfall of 29 800 primary care physicians by 2015 and 65 800 by 2025 mainly because of the anticipated increase in demand for services from the Affordable Care Act ACA deterrents to entering the field such as relatively lower incomes and growth in the general population and specifically growth in the elderly population Should the ACA pass muster with the Supreme Court next month an additional 30 to 33 million previously uninsured Americans will be covered and even if ACA is not implemented in full and in the end merely expands Medicaid it will add 17 million to the insured ranks by 2020 One of the best ways to alleviate this shortage is to expand the scope of practice for advanced practice registered nurses APRNs well trained registered nurses with specialized qualifications who can make diagnoses order tests and referrals and write prescriptions APRNs could provide a variety of services that primary care physicians now provide The definitive word on medical practice in America the highly respected and impartial Institute of Medicine IOM of the National Academy of Sciences has weighed in on this idea of allowing APRNs to do more in a landmark 2010 report The Future of Nursing The IOM conducted an exhaustive review of all the available studies of the efficacy and safety of care provided by APRNs and concluded that properly trained APRNs can independently provide core primary care services as effectively as physicians They can provide wellness and preventive care services diagnose and manage common uncomplicated acute illnesses and help patients manage chronic diseases such as diabetes In its report the National Academy of Sciences recommended that a dvanced practice registered nurses should be able to practice to the full extent of their education and training But despite an urgent need and clear evidence that APRNs can complement and extend primary care providers roles without sacrificing quality of care nurses are only permitted to practice independently to the full extent of their training and competence in 16 states and the District of Columbia The remaining states impose regulatory barriers that limit their scope of practice These barriers should and can be removed But the turf wars of organized medicine are preventing progress The American Medical Association the American Osteopathic Association the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians all oppose expanding the scope of nurse practitioner responsibilities despite the IOM report and recent research demonstrating that an expanded scope of practice for APRNs has no impact on primary care physician income In Colorado where there are far too few anesthesiologists available for rural and critical access hospitals the state s medical and anesthesiologists societies sued to overturn former Governor Bill Ritter s 2010 decision to allow Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists CRNAs to provide anesthesia and pain management care in these hospitals Instead they prefer to make people travel hundreds of miles out of their communities to have a procedure that a CRNA is licensed and trained to carry out They are also apparently fine with hospitals being forced to close as a result of a lack of anesthesiologists This is a classic example of doctor centric care trumping patient centric care Apparently the physician organizations are threatened by some mix of concerns about lost income and their traditional position as captain of the ship Those opposed to expanding the scope of nurses practice also argue that physicians with more years of training under their belts must necessarily know more than an APRN ever could Of course they know more but it is well established that they do not know more about providing the core elements of basic primary care And why primary care physicians already overburdened and overworked wouldn t want some support with routine care and services is puzzling Allowing well trained APRNs to handle routine care frees up physicians focus on diagnostic dilemmas and more complex management issues while dramatically reducing waiting times for care Expanding nursing scope of practice not only can help fill the gap in primary care providers but it can save money as well RAND estimates that in Massachusetts using nurse practitioners to their full capacity could save the state between 4 2 and 8 4 billion over ten years Other studies find sizable savings from care provided by nurses in clinics in retail pharmacies In these cases APRNs have the authority to diagnose treat and prescribe medications among other services Also tapping nursing s potential is the fastest and least expensive way to meet growing demand for primary care Nurses can be trained faster and for a lot less than medical school costs Between three and 12 nurses can be educated for the price of one doctor There is hope Employers and patients are beginning to clamor for progress in this area and the turf wars may lose steam as we move away from fee for service and toward accountable

increasing demands to save money and restructure how we receive and pay for health care The inconsistent often punitive and highly politicized regulatory environment surrounding APRNs must recognize

physicians? allowing nurses to act as primary-care providers will increase coverage and lower health-care costs. so why is there so much opposition from physicians? the atlantic, the atlantic

everything she was doing and get back home to make lunch I had an almost similar moment the other morning a moment where I raced back from the bus stop after dropping the lad and switched on the oven There was nothing more that I wanted to do than bake Clementines Butterscotch Brownies I love a good productive morning though these days they are few and far between Most of them are pretty frustrating as laid out plans fall to nought like the day when the preteen woke up showered to go to school then looked pale and green Fever It was back to bed for him took care of the rest of my day Then late the same night I was reading the LA Times Food newsletter which always makes me hungry I love the Culinary SOS recipes and spent too much time lost in the pages What caught my eye was the Carpe Diem s Mexican chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me but I didn t have that many eggs in the larder for 6 egg yolks One thing led to another and I landed up at these Clementine s butterscotch brownies I knew instantly what I would be doing the next morning after making sure the lad was packed off to school It was fun doing these fuss free and simple like baking on the fast track It s a GREAT recipe These are GOOD you know exclaimed the not so terrible anymore teen I like the flavours the tinge of salt with the sweetness the caramel like feel to these Are these brownies They are called butterscotch brownies though I was tempted to call them blondies I got 16 pieces out of the batch nice slightly chewy as we like them with a pleasing depth in taste YUM They packed a neat bite Not sure how you toast your walnuts almonds etc but I now fast track that too in the microwave for 3 4 minutes Keep an eye on them give them a quick stir halfway through and they are toasted enough Cool and chop my Ergo chef knives work like a charm here By the time the oven was preheated the batter was ready and they baked in next to no time Later that day Mr PAB and me went out for a bit indulged whole heartedly in Indian street food then he obligingly took me to shop at the dusty little gypsies tents read very dusty I go there often you can see some more of my shopping on this guest post here Mr PAB is a man of patience I walked from one dusty tent to another from the side of my eyes I could see the car crawl along no pressure nothing NICE I bought a few battered wooden boxes rushed home dusted washed sun dried and oiled them Used one for the butterscotch brownies above The old gypsy who sold them to me was H A P P Y and rushed to get his hookah when I asked if I could take some pictures had my P S in my bag Look at him no pressure of the daily grind enjoying what he was doing making metal cheese graters by hand and ever so obliging And now over to Clementine s butterscotch

have you wrought A few years ago at the beginning of the chef revolution young cooks stopped cooking what was expected and started cooking what they wanted to eat The resulting meat centric balls out approach was both exciting and refreshing bringing with it some of the last decade s most astonishing food Suddenly spice salt fat offal cult seafood items and stinky cheese became the norm Restaurants that 10 years ago would have seemed like risky business propositions became the model for many young chef owners You must have livers You must have uni You must have octopus belly meat bacon in places where no bacon has gone before This is certainly the tradition claimed by Eric Park the young chef behind Black Hogg in Silver Lake Black Hogg opened last March with an aggressively meat centric menu a sparse and tiny storefront space on Sunset no liquor license and a setup where you had to trek through the kitchen to get to the bathroom The place was a hit from the get go packed on most nights despite the lack of booze In August Black Hogg closed to prepare for a liquor license which required a renovation mainly having to do with the lavatory situation It reopened in November with a more traditional bathroom setup beer and a short wine list As his press coverage had it Park is an alumnus of the French Culinary Institute in New York and a guy who d worked in both April Bloomfield s seminal New York nose to tail gastropub Spotted Pig and Eleven Madison Park one of the country s best restaurants Impressive right Yet the truth is a little trickier Park s most vaunted jobs Eleven Madison Park and the Spotted Pig were both brief part time noncredited internships while he attended FCI Outside of these internships and his nine months in culinary school Park has only a couple months of real restaurant employment the kind you get paid for the kind you would call experience There s absolutely no reason to hold this against him but it does explain quite a bit about Black Hogg Spotted Pig is an obvious inspiration for Park s cooking although even Spotted Pig isn t quite so aggressively meat focused meaning vegetables are a strong point on Bloomfield s menu along with the pork belly and pig ears But the one true vegetable focused dish on Park s menu is also one of his best Brussels sprouts and Yukon gold potatoes topped with a poached egg the Brussels twice cooked so the flurry of shattery leaves on the outside gives way to a soft inside The bacon vinaigrette brings the dish together with an acid tang balancing and harmonizing Egg and acid make an appearance also on the b\u00e1hn m\u00ec a deeply satisfying sandwich of mortadella capicola p\u00e2t\u00e9 and a vinegary slaw topped with a runny egg Purists will complain that 14 could buy you as many as seven b\u00e1hn m\u00ec at any of the city s best Vietnamese b\u00e1hn m\u00ec houses but this sandwich is highly edible nonetheless Then comes the deep fried bacon Called popcorn bacon on the menu it s a small dish holding cubes of bacon breaded and fried served with maple crema It s fat fried in fat served with a side of sugary fat Here s where Black Hogg really starts to go off the rails where the ingredients and trends of the day are taken to extremes without an ounce of subtlety and presented as delicious simply because they exist Chopped chicken liver on toast is good right How about we make it spicy spicy food is good right How about we top it with chicken skin cracklin because cracklin is good right Never mind that the spice and salt obliterate the magnanimous creamy nature of the livers And never mind that livers alone are almost impossibly wonderfully rich and that adding more intense fat and salt in the form of a cracklin takes it so far overboard that it loses all that s good and right and amazing about a chicken liver The same is true for the uni toast two quivering globs of Santa Barbara sea urchin served on grilled bread with Plugr\u00e1 butter scallions and salt All that makes uni the strange magical ingredient it is all its sex and funk and creamy subtlety is lost in the textural heavy handedness of the butter and bread All you taste is the harsh carbon of a hot grill meeting buttery bread the soft touch of the ocean is obliterated Much goes outrageously overboard here in a way that s almost fun and then not fun at all The meat for a lamb burger is ground with butter for a burger that literally gushes fat not just the butter in the meat why but blue cheese as well It s a flavor bomb for sure but more than a little off putting The one vegetarian dish is a huge slice of brioche soaked in brown butter with crimini shimeji and hen of the woods mushrooms It s too much It might work as an hors d oeuvre perhaps but as an entire plate of food it is pornographic see more of anne fishbein's photos of black hogg. oh, dude food, what have you wrought? a few years ago, at the beginning of the chef revolution, young cooks stopped cooking

waterin Even my kids enjoy stir fry although for some reason they like to have their rice separate from their meat and veggies It could also be that I put a homemade chocolate chip cookie on a stick

Cloves of Garlic Minced2 Tsp of Sugar1 4 Cup of Fresh Ginger Chopped A few things to note You probably already know this but you can mix or match any veggies you want in this stir fry Use what you have add something else you d like It s up to you You can also change up the meat or leave the meat out all together We just happen to have a ton of chicken in our house so squawking bawking egg laying bird meat it is Now on to the good stuff Grab your wok and swirl 1 tbsp of your sesame oil in the bottom of it Turn your heat on high and give it a couple minutes to heat up Once your wok is

and set it aside to keep warm Swirl the additional 2 tbsp of sesame oil in the pan give it a minute to heat up and add your vegetables Add the veggies that need a little additional time to cook first

fitting better already Swimsuit season here we come Mix your vegetables up and let them cook for 4 5 minutes more Your dish should be starting to look yummy and honestly it should be looking downright pretty Look at the color in those vegetables Once your vegetables are cooked through remove them from the wok and set them aside to keep warm Now it s time to whip up the best part of a stir fry the sauce To the wok add your chicken stock rice vinegar sherry garlic sugar and ginger Let the mixture cook up for 2 3 minutes so the flavors can combine While your sauce is cooking take your 2 tbsp of corn starch and add it to your soy sauce Stir it well to combine Now add that mixture into your cooking sauce Let your sauce come to a boil stirring constantly and then drop the temperature down to medium low Your sauce should be thickening up nicely Once it s thickened you can throw your meat and veggies back into the pot and stir it up well to combine And holy moly if that doesn t look like

management: 6 ways to improve your productivity"",""body"":""If you resolved earlier this month to work smarter stop procrastinating and be more productive your best intentions may have quickly been subverted by your regularly scheduled work routine Workplace performance expert Jason Womack says changing the way we do our work to improve our productivity is hard because our processes have become habit and in many cases these habits have made us successful even if they drove us to the edge of sanity in the process A mid level manager for example has probably gotten in the habit of living by the ding of email or the buzz of the BlackBerry says Womack and they ve probably been rewarded for their responsiveness If they haven t addressed that Pavlovian response it will be difficult for them to shift their habits The biggest mistake professionals make when it comes to time management adds Womack is continuing to use their time for activities that no longer deserve it They keep going when they should be done he says They keep typing an email when they ve already answered a question in the subject line They keep talking on the phone when they ve already addressed the purpose of the call They stay in the meeting room after the meeting points have been covered To prevent you from making those same mistakes Womack shares six of his most effective time management and productivity boosting tips 1 Stick to the 15 minute rule Womack recommends organizing your workday into 15 minute chunks If you work eight hours a day you ve got 32 15 minute chunks A 10 hour workday gives you 40 15 minute chunks Womack emphasizes 15 minutes because he says it s long enough to get something done and short enough to find in your day When you have to schedule a meeting or conference call that would typically take an hour Womack tells his clients to start it at 15 minutes past the hour and to end it on the hour He believes people can accomplish in 45 minutes that is three 15 minute chunks what they think they need 60 minutes for Containing the meeting to 45 minutes forces you to keep it on point and gives you an extra 15 minute chunk in which you can address another item on your to do list 2 Know when you re done Continuing to work on something when it is essentially done is a significant time waster that most professionals aren t even aware of People need to think through the When am I done question says Womack who is also the author of Your Best Just Got Better Work Smarter Think Bigger Make More Wiley 2012 When I get a nonfiction book I m done with that book when I ve learned something from the author that I didn t know before he says I ve picked up books paid 24 95 read it for two or three 15 minute chunks learned something and given the book to my seatmate on a plane 3 Eliminate distractions Eliminating distractions may not be a new time management tip but Womack s advice for avoiding specific distractions such as a niggling coworker or a nagging manager is novel and effective If your manager is prone to interrupting you with questions Womack suggests preempting her For example instead of waiting for your manager to show up at your desk or ping you approach her first at a few minutes before the hour say a 10 52 or 10 55 AM ideally before a meeting or call He says to tell her I have a bunch of things I m working on and a meeting at 11 and I m trying to get any interruptions out of the way Do you have anything you need to tell me or ask me before my meeting and before my work gets underway Another tip from Womack If you have a quick question for someone but don t want to get caught up in a protracted conversation around it call your contact or stop by his desk a few minutes before the hour knowing that he might have a meeting on the hour and won t have time for chit chat either 4 Identify verbs that need attention Womack recommends organizing your to do list around verbs such as call draft review prepare and schedule Those are tasks you can generally complete in one sitting and that help move a larger project forward he says If you have big picture verbs on your to do list such as plan discuss create or implement replace them with action steps that break down the big picture project adds Womack Doing so will help you get started and reduce any feelings of being overwhelmed 5 Be prepared for bonus time The next time you find out your flight s been delayed or your doctor is running late don t get annoyed Recognize that you ve just been given the gift of bonus time If you bring some work with you wherever you go as Womack suggests you ll have the chance to tackle it whether that s responding to email making a call reviewing a proposal or drafting a plan 6 Use email shortcuts Womack notes that both the BlackBerry and iPhone allow users to create quick keys or keyboard shortcuts when using the smartphones for email He created several keyboard short cuts that call up boiler plate text that he frequently reuses For example if someone emails Womack asking him for information on how to use Microsoft Outlook more effectively all he has to do is type his shortcut OL which automatically populates his email with a response to the question This video demonstrates how to create these keyboard shortcuts on an iPhone 4S These shortcuts save Womack a ton of time since he s developed several for answers to some of the most common questions people ask him It prevents him from having to recreate the answer every time someone emails him It also saves him from having to search his sent folder and having to copy and paste the answer into email productivity, if you resolved earlier this month to work smarter, stop procrastinating and be more productive, your best intentions may have quickly been subverted by your regularly scheduled work routine."",""url"":""pcworld businesscenter article 248436 time management 6 ways to improve your productivity

contingency disease famine political instability drought weather aliens the plot of Armageddon coming true and protecting super evolved man from his primitive cousins There are actual plans for every one of those scenarios There are entire real government programs devoted solely to thinking up ways to counter weather themed supervillains and other outlandish threats normally relegated to the realm of science fiction Like these 5 Talking to or Covering Up Extraterrestrials Are we alone If not what will happen when we finally meet creatures from another planet Will they be peaceful Hostile Will we be able to mate with them Captain Kirk style If not why not Seriously Why not One reason These are questions movies and television shows have been asking for decades And somewhat inexplicably the government has been as well It s not so far fetched After all while the chance of finding life out there other than ourselves is infinitesimal we have been trying it for years We ve been sending radio waves into space with SETI Voyager 1 has reached the edge of our solar system and is still moving out into deep space and we pretty much call all alien life forms pussies in countless movies that we then beam out in every direction It s practically inevitable that they re coming This film will be the blackface of the 24th century So what is the government doing about it Way back in 1960 when Americans were first getting a boner for all things to do with space hereby shortened to the Space Boner era Congress commissioned an official report on what sorts of things could happen once we launched ourselves out of Earth s atmosphere This was called Proposed Studies on the Implications of Peaceful Space Activities for Human Affairs or the Brookings Report because PSIPSAHA is kind of a sucky acronym It sounds kind of like the noise you make when you stub a toe Most of the report was pretty snooze worthy but there was one section called Implications of a discovery of extraterrestrial life that made people sit up and take notice And then void their bowels upon reading such reassuring findings as If superintelligence is discovered the results become quite unpredictable There are many examples of societies sure of their place in the universe which have disintegrated when they had to associate with previously unfamiliar societies How might such information be presented to or withheld from the public Yep the whole thing pretty much reads like an X file All it s missing is a righteously indignant Mulder screaming about the truth while giving sultry looks to the camera Doo dee da da dee doo But America is far from the only nation worried about meeting ET Even the Vatican is devoting serious thought to an idea formerly relegated to trailer parks and hill folk Father Jose Funes speaking for the Vatican after its official conference on astrobiology wait what stated that the church has concluded that the existence of life on other planets would not invalidate anything in the Bible And Guy Consolmagno one of the pope s astronomers wait double what said that he would be delighted to baptize any extra terrestrial life that comes his way but only if they asked And promised to put the probe down first 4 Leaving Warning Messages for Humans of the Far Future Major civilizations come and go over the course of history Even ones that dominate for thousands of years will eventually fall into dust But they always leave shit buried in the dirt Since the statute of limitations for littering is probably just short of a few thousand years we accept that fact and use these leavings to study them One day in turn somebody will be studying us the same way What our early ancestors needed with one fingered gloves we may never know And we re probably going to kill them for it See unlike previous civilizations where the biggest worry was uncovering somebody caught rubbing one out while Vesuvius erupted our society is capable of leaving things that will stay dangerous basically forever Like Yucca Mountain the giant soon to be glowing mound in Nevada and America s possible storage facility for nuclear waste If we do end up dumping tons of radioactive material there any future people or aliens who dig it up are going to seriously regret messing with the past Hey it s like we re setting up our own mummy s curse Awesome Bjorn no one would go to the trouble of hollowing out a mountain if they weren t hiding some real cool shit So what is the government doing about it Assuming that we are an altruistic people and don t want the people of the future to all die horrible deaths although they do kind of seem like dicks all smug with their hyper cars and stupid transmogrifiers we need a way to warn them where not to dig So it s a good thing the U S Department of Energy has been paying people to think about this issue for years What s so hard about that though Just slap up a sign explaining the damn thing and be done with it The only problem being that the Environmental Protection Agency has demanded that the warning signs be visible and understandable by anyone who might seen them for the next 10 000 years Iconography cultural touchstones and language will all be entirely different in 10 000 years Communicating anything to people of the far flung future is nearly impossible For example according to the government our current nuclear waste symbol sort of looks like an angel It could be misconstrued as a religious sign or a message of peace right up until they start digging into all of our poisons Eh either an angel or Lady Gaga s Tomb Palace So we can t mark nuclear waste sites with that sign lest we want future us s children doing snow angels in rotten plutonium That s why the Department of Energy gathered a group of intellectuals from a huge variety of backgrounds including history risk analysis and engineering to brainstorm solutions to the problem Dubbed the Futures Panel they came up with ideas like the landscape of thorns a visual warning made up of gargantuan 50 foot tall concrete pillars with spikes jutting out of them That or else just littering the place with human bodies Because subtlety does not translate well over millennia Of course as with most government projects the bad ass ideas were discarded for cost restrictions If the Yucca Mountain project goes through the current plan is to build large earthen berms in layman s terms piles of dirt to warn people of the future Because large piles of dirt might not be foreboding understandable or long lasting but man are they DIRT cheap Ha ha But seriously you ll die if you fuck with that dirt Future You guys know what this would be good for Storing drinking water 3 Fighting Asteroids with Robots Asteroids fly past Earth with a slightly worrying frequency especially since we don t know most of them are even there until they pass us The sun literally blinds astronomers to their presence so the chances of us knowing that one is on a collision course is infinitesimal So what do we do if we ever actually have a window of time when we know the Big One is coming Personally we re going to go with big drunken orgy of crime followed by panic and crying Stock up on tear gas and Molotov mixins early to take advantage of the best deals Fortunately the government has a different plan So what is the government doing about it Unfortunately it s straight from the plot of Armageddon A group of concerned astronauts from the U S and Canada have presented the U N with a report detailing the need for an asteroid impact contingency Indeed the astronauts claim that we already have all the technology necessary to go all Armageddon on any bitch ass asteroid fool enough to step to us given enough time that is What s enough time An astonishingly unlikely 20 years heads up in some cases That s how long scientists would need for the safest plan which involves using mirrors or lights to deflect an asteroid off course just enough to miss us Currently the shall we say less safe plan is to land people or robots if they re advanced enough for the task by then but not advanced enough that they realize it s a batshit insane plan on the surface of the asteroid Then yep it unfolds exactly like the movie The astronauts drill inside the rock and detonate a bomb to slightly change the massive rock s trajectory in theory saving the human race Of course if the bomb is too effective we ll just get lots of smaller but still deadly asteroids changing the space bullet into more of a space shotgun blast but hey there are always kinks to work out The big downside there s a bigger downside than space shotgun blast is that even with the resources of the most advanced countries in the world at their disposal scientists still predict the human race needs at least 10 years to prepare In that case it s a good thing they re working on it now We already know there is a possible contender for the plan headed our way in 2029 and again in 2036 there are entire real government programs devoted solely to thinking up ways to counter weather-themed supervillains and other outlandish threats normally relegated to the realm of science fiction. there are entire real government programs devoted solely to thinking up ways to counter weather-themed supervillains and other outlandish threats normally relegated to

lead a balanced life because if you do then you enjoy every moment and every second you can cope with any difficulties you can be happy without any reason to be happy you can be yourself and love the person you are Today the world constantly tries to throw you out of balance and sometimes no matter what you do you still feel like your life is going in the wrong direction I know I feel this way sometimes Balanced living might seem like one of those theoretical terms that nobody can put into practice but in fact there is nothing simpler than living a balanced life It might take some work at first but once you get in the flow and discover the simple ways to steer your life in your desired direction you will feel empowered You will be inspired and energized by every day of your life Your life will be full of amazing adventures and events that will make every day memorable You won t be wasting your life anymore or spending gloomy hours contemplating about the misfortunes that might have happened on your way Does balanced living mean that your life will be full of only positive people and events that will bring you happiness every moment of your life Not at all Balanced living is when you can always offset any negative events in your life with positive ones It is also when you can see the light at the end of the tunnel Balanced living is when you are happy working and playing equally If you picture happiness and everything great in your life as a diamond then any negative things that may happen are just the setting that makes this diamond shine only brighter If you want to live a balanced life then there are 5 essential habits that you need to develop Awareness and mindfulness Awareness is the key to balanced living because it lets you see every moment of your life and appreciate it A mindful person lives in the present and does not get obsessed with the future or the past It s important to plan for the future and learn from your mistakes in the past but it is even more important to appreciate who you are right now and find joy in this state When you are aware of this moment you are calm and you do not make any decisions that you might regret later When you are mindful you are in balance with the universe Appreciation of your body By appreciation I mean taking care of your body If you are grateful for the very first gift that you received in your life your body then you must take care of it It means making healthy choices in life exercising and being generally active eating a balanced and healthy diet letting your body rest when it s tired and pampering it every once in a while Your body is the tool that lets you experience so many wonderful moments in life and you need to do your best when taking care of it Clearly balanced living is not possible without a balanced body Creativity Every day we face a lot of challenges and choices in life Some of these challenges might be easy while others will be more difficult If you approach each of your challenges with creativity then your life will be filled with adventures Conversely if you turn off your creativity then your life will turn into torture Creativity is a wonderful tool that lets us turn our dreams into reality turn play into work and work into play and enjoy life even when it seems empty Creative people are the ones who can make the exquisite setting for the diamond of their life Patience With patience we can overcome almost anything whilst without it we can ruin almost anything Patience can help us turn our dreams into reality losing weight starting a business or blog It can help us be better parents spouses friends and even strangers sometimes a smile from an understanding stranger can make the biggest difference when you are having a bad day If you are patient you do not have to worry about the minutes spent in traffic or in the line at the grocery store With patience you can see results in all your endeavors and you do not have to spend the precious time of your life getting mad or infuriated Patience leads to mindfulness and mindfulness brings you in balance Simplicity Simplicity is probably the most important part of life balance When you build your life around simplicity you reduce the number of out of balance things that can disrupt your happy living In balance everything is simple There are two opposites like black and white and you just have to pick something in the middle Simplify you work schedule so that you do not have to think about a hundred things at the same time Simplify your relationships by connecting with people you truly care about and getting rid of the ones you don t Simplify your diet by choosing simple healthy ingredients that are part of balanced nutrition Simplify your social media exposure and enjoy living life and getting things done rather than wasting time online Simplicity makes life balance simple These habits have been my lifeline for many years and I cannot imagine a balanced and happy life without them Living in balance is easy and very rewarding because your life becomes the one of joy happiness and serenity If you put some time and effort into turning your life into a balanced direction then you

Fortunately this is an area where modern snack foods excel There is quite a selection of wire shaped extruded food and we get our pick of it First these are Fruit Streamers fruit snacks in the shape of a ribbon cable with wires that can be pulled apart Neat While these purport to be polychromatic the blue and green strands can hardly be told apart and the opacity leaves something to be desired None the less here they are Haribo licorice wheels are a good source of red or black wire The rolls are very long and give you by far the longest wires that we had to work with Downside They tend to retain a serious curl even after dereeling Note we aren t sure why the red ones presumably made in the same factory are so much smaller Maybe that s how you re supposed to tell the genders apart or something Air Heads Xtremes Sweetly Sour Belts What the heck is it So far as I know belt is not the name of any type of food None the less these exist and were in the candy aisle I therefore infer that these are actually meant to be eaten While the colors are bright and the components do separate this was just awful to work with the sticky surface texture left you feeling like you d just been handling salted fluorescent bacon Yuck They didn t even get the colors of the rainbow in the right order If you leave it intact it might make a good looking ribbon cable but it s probably not worth the hassle These Twizzlers Twisted berry wires er candy strands turned out to be the nicest to work with Disgusting yet great Very bright opaque visible strong and can be neatly spliced On the down side it would be nice if they were longer They can be easily separated right into bright red and blue parts there are also dull purple wires along for the ride Here we have an assortment of roll candies SweeTarts Necco wafers Lifesavers Gummies Lifesavers 5 flavor Lifesavers wint o green These are to various degrees good raw materials for making cylindrical components like resistors or capacitors On the right is one of our failed experiments It s a stack of Necco wafers where the colors are picked to make a resistor Brown Black Yellow Gold or 100 k 5 The stack is held together with layers of icing While this is an easy approach it just doesn t look that good That s because the color saturation of Necco wafers is poor and their inconsistent shape leads to large gaps between neighboring wafers Perhaps a better use for the Necco wafers would be as ceramic disc capacitors We made most of our resistors by creating stacks of four wint o green life savers held together by icing Once the icing has set just a few minutes you can use food coloring to paint the rings with the appropriate color code brown black yellow gold in this case The great things about this technique are 1 it leaves a hole to put your wire through and 2 the white candy surface takes most colorations very well There are certainly a lot of other ways to build resistors and keep in mind that there is a lot of variation amongst even standard resistors On the right is a set of food coloring pens that we used to help color in the lines on the resistor These are like the ones that we used to write on hearts but with a broader tip This mixture of licorice candies simply boggles the mind Not only are there the usual licorice allsorts but gummy bears and even gummy frogs It looks like it s whatever fell off the side of the conveyor belt in the factory that makes the Haribo licorice candies The most unusual ones are interesting A variety of odd shapes that look a lot like the odd shapes of capacitors that are available With the help of some pretzel sticks you can take any one of those strange candy coated licorice bits and turn it into an electrolytic capacitor with radial leads We recently found these Haribo Brixx which are thankfully not actually brick flavored What s interesting is that if you slice these thin they make a great model of a certain type of capacitor Regular old marshmallows While these can be used for many different purposes in circuitry snacks there are a few places where they really excel As battery cells as large electrolytic capacitors and when painted with a suitable set of colored stripes resistors On the right you can see one dressed up as a C cell an icing bump was added to one end of the marshmallow before painting that end orange Two other building blocks that we have found to be generally handy Miniature marshmallows and Tootsie rolls These miniature marshmallows come in a variety of pastel colors but white will work just as well They can be used in a variety of ways as small electrolytic capacitors as inductors as glass passivated components like diodes and if painted suitably as resistors in a circuit Tootsie rolls are sculptable raw material for which the possibilities are endless For some earlier designs we wrapped colored licorice bands around them to make resistors with color codes What is a jujube We ve always heard it pronounced Joo Joo Bees but the spelling looks like it should read Joo Joobs Regardless these hard little translucent cylinders are a bizarre suspension of sugar starch and mineral oil hence the fat free logo They look a little bit like LEDs or the lenses that go over them If you wanted to build the edible equivalent of an LED matrix these are your best bet The translucent quality also lends them to play the role of glass encapsulated diodes On the right are several 1N914 small signal diodes that we ve assembled from pretzel sticks icing food coloring and either a jujube or a miniature marshmallow Dots are little gumdrops that look like regular sized T 1 3 4 LEDs if you stand them up on two toothpicks or pretzel sticks The prominent LED in the picture at the top of the photo is one of these Much like LEDs regular Dots come in red orange yellow and green If you want the elusive blue ones you have to look hard In this case we found them in the box of Tropical Dots There is also a second variety of black colored Dots called Crows Crows are essentially identical in shape and size and look like infrared LEDs or phototransistors Any number of chocolate bar like foods can be made into edible versions of integrated circuits Kit Kat Twix and Mini Charleston Chews are small components that make good models of integrated circuits in long skinny packages Chocolate covered graham crackers are another good option The aspect ratio is good for doing large scale models of e g 8 pin DIP packages These are the ones that we made into 555s The fudge sticks are neatly rectangular layered wafer cookies with a thin chocolate coating It s kind of like a Kit Kat bar in the limit where the cookie goes to unit volume where the chocolate coating goes to zero volume Because they are so neatly rectangular they make a good medium size chip Actually they don t taste half bad either To make these chocolate bar like items into chips use hard icing to add a legend to the top a marker by pin 1 and the correct number of pins to the edges Be sure to do this on waxed paper or parchment paper so that you can unstick the legs after they harden The smaller chips here are charleston chew based quad op amps TL074 The two ATtiny2313s shown here are based on a fudge stick and a Kit Kat The three 555 chips at a different scale are made from chocolate covered graham crackers with icing detail Twizzlers nibs short black pieces of licorice with a D shaped profile Perfect for making those little TO 92 shaped food projects e g a 2N3904 transistor Here we ve written the designation on the surface it s very tricky to squeeze out icing that fine We ve also added three toothpick feet Toothpicks are not strictly speaking food However they are often allowed as structural component to assemble food An even better trick is to avoid the use of toothpicks at all by making edible legs for your components You can do this by making rigid icing rods Lay down even stripes of icing on parchment paper and allow to dry overnight Pick them off the parchment and use icing to attach them where they need to go In this case we ve made a transistor by sticking several of the solidified icing sticks to the bottom of the licorice piece This way it s fully edible much better than using toothpicks Let s start putting some boards together On the left is a simple board featuring a full size Kit Kat made into an AVR ATmega168 We have supplied this board with power connections via the ribbon cable In the board on the right we have an ATtiny2313 a TL074 quad op amp and a 1N914 diode For both of these boards we are modeling the circuit as a printed circuit board where the components are visible but the traces on the printed circuit board are not it s certainly sufficient detail for most folks to recognize this as a circuit board The next step is to make the logical leap to designing a detailed circuit out of edible components What s better than a 555 LED blinking circuit A 555 LED blinking circuit that you can eat To make this we started with the graham cracker circuit board two 100k brown black yellow resistors and one 330 ohm orange orange black all made from lifesavers The 555 is a chocolate covered graham cracker the 1 uF ceramic disc capacitor was formerly a Nilla wafer The 9V battery was made from a fun size Three Musketeers bar The red LED came out of a box of Dots and all the wiring is Twizzlers berry wire all soldered together with hard icing This circuit is the starting point for a lot of good things for example the Cylon Pumpkin The next circuit that we re building here is a Joule Thief a simple boosting power supply that can run a blue LED from a single 1 5 V battery That s a neat trick since it usually takes at least 3 5 V to run a blue LED This circuitry snack contains a marshmallow battery a 1 k brown black red resistor a bifilar wound toroidal coil wound around a Sushki like a hard miniature bagel cookie a 2N3904 transistor and a blue LED So we ve walked through some of the snack food choices that seem promising for circuitry snacks how to assemble them into simulated electronic components and how to put them all together on an edible circuit board What other cool ideas for candy circuits can you come up with We re looking forward to seeing the results "",""url"":""evilmadscientist article php circuitsnacks

jewellery person I only own a handful of pretty pieces but often have to remind myself to put them on before I leave the house Rings are a generally a no no I fiddle with them too much and I haven t worn earrings for around 5 years ditto That was until I got these Horse Studs from London based designer Smith Grey at Bottica If I m going to adorn myself with pieces of metal they have to be cute pieces of metal and what could be cuter than a horses rear end sticking out of your ear lobe Their entire collection is full of horses but this quirky pair of studs were my favourite piece I can pretend I ve got a miniature golden horse jumping through my head Another addition to my slowly growing collection is this adorable key bracelet from Benita Blue and a new pal in the form of this little mouse that grabs on to my little finger a gift from my best friend Katie who has just opened her own online jewellery shop Cherry Humbug where you can find Mr Mouse for a mere 3 I m not ready to start spending any serious dosh on jewellery but like nail polish I m learning to try and appreciate it which is usually accomplished a lot quicker when said item is animal themed next on my wish list is this beauty x P S I m totally working on a DIY with all of those pearls Watch this space Earrings Smith Grey via Bottica Bracelet Benita Blue Ring Cherry Humbug Dress Family Affairs Cardigan Licia Florio March 12th 2012 Audrey Grace Months and months ago now I was interviewed by the lovely Jaclyn for the online manifestation of her shop Audrey Grace Boutique I m sure you ll all heard about Audrey Grace by now Jaclyn has teamed up with some of my favourite bloggers designers photographers and illustrators to create what can only be described as a dream world Unfortunately the majority of us won t be able to visit the physical store currently located in Jackson Mississippi but it is popping up in New York next week too for those of you living in the Big Apple For those of us not lucky enough to finger through the rails full of Vivetta TBA Alexandra Grecco Dear Creatures and more we ll live vicariously through her collaborations one of which I was lucky enough to be a part of Jaclyn sent me this beautiful TBA dress to style and photograph I was initially worried about it s sleevelessness given both the cold and my dislike for showing my arms irrational I know but that was soon remedied by my BOTM blouse of the moment of course It s charming print is what makes it so special adorned with ballerinas and swans It brought me back to my ballet days which I unfortunately quit after grade 6 but remember it with fondness I would turn up with a mess of black eyeliner and a band t shirt over my leotard not the typical ballerina I know When giving the old pointe shoes a try taking these pictures I realised what hard work it was and how out of shape I ve become there is still a bit of grace left in me though I d like to think Giveaway 100 voucher to spend at Audrey Grace Even if you can t pop by for a visit Jaclyn wanted to offer one lucky commenter the chance to put 100 towards their favourite dreamy dress all you have to do is let me know your favourite Audrey Hepburn or Grace Kelly film in your comment The winner will be contacted by Jaclyn who will let you know which of your favourite brands she s currently got in stock and send you out your favourite piece Easy peasy The giveaway is open internationally and I ll announce the winner on Saturday 17th Good luck x March 8th 2012 Wandering These pictures sum up my second and final day in Berlin I could probably do it in a few phrases too big yummy breakfast bubbles and more bubbles new nail varnish kebab and exploring a city in heels Less than 48 hours in a city doesn t really give you a proper feel for it but I experienced a taste As Shini and I burned off the calories consumed at our extravagant German breakfast put on by Zalando we came across endless beautiful design shops and cafes dotted about the place Berlin has a very artistic feel to it perhaps contributed in some part to the graffiti daubed on most surfaces which certainly gives it identity It s almost East London complete with kebabs which I couldn t help but try unfortunately for my waistline kebab is my favourite takeaway But I did branch out from my favourites a bit I drank my first Bubble Tea not something I ll be trying again in a hurry I can assure you We tried to fit in as much as possible making our way to the Brandenburg Gate and back popping in to far too many expensive boutiques on the way That might be why the only purchases were made in American Apparel of all places I d love to return for a more relaxing stay and check out a few of the many museums and galleries we passed the place is full of history and I m sure there is much more to it than street art and kebabs See you again Berlin And a huge thanks to Zalando for having me x Dress A P C Blouse New Look Shoes Urban Outfitters Tights Topshop Bag YesStyle UK March 5th 2012 Practising My German If you follow me on Twitter you ll have seen that I spent a couple of days last week in Berlin This was all thanks to the wonderful Zalando who invited myself and several other bloggers over for the launch of their first collection Whilst I love clothes I could never turn down the chance to travel somewhere new this was my first time in Germany a place I d wanted to travel since grasping the basics of the language back at school many years ago Ich bin einundzwanzig jahre alt etc etc I didn t get to put it to much use though my partner in crime Shini was the first to put to practice her language skills leaving me with the polite Danke sch\u00f6n as we hopped out of the taxi Unfortunately I don t have many recommendations we spent the most part of the two days wandering the streets discussing different cultures and architecture whilst looking for a place to eat junk food but I would thoroughly recommend the hotel we stayed in My room witnessed silly Photoboothing the endless search for something English on TV and a very comfortable bed But I ll have more about the city in the next post for now let s talk clothes The Zalando Collection I swapped my loafers for heels brushed my windswept hair and put on a bit of lippy for the main event the launch of Zalando s new collection and pop up store It was packed to the brim with trendy people speaking a plethora of languages so Shini and I found a spot in the corner to take goofy pictures in the mirror The collection itself was dotted around the space in pretty pastel tones but with a sporty edge not immediately my thing I thought until I got looking and found some gems a sky blue vest with a new take on the collar and summery court shoes in a variety of pastel hues They had artists creating murals on the temporary walls using tape the vibe was distinctly cool definitely a word I d use to sum up Berlin After eating one too many of the chocolate cakes that were permeating the crowd we called it a night ready to rest our feet for another day of wandering the city watch this space x

Noel Columbia University Photo Credit 1One of the few things that makes Monday mornings even more dreadful than they already are is when one has to rummage in the laundry hamper dig through the drawers and tear through the closet in order to piece together a superb outfit and make it on time to work or school As ideal as spending the previous night picking out and coordinating the perfect outfit sounds in our minds in reality most of us are either too busy or too tired to bother Yet most of us also refuse to or just can t opt for sloppy less snappy ensembles Photo Credits 1 2 3In light of the time crunch college students face a uniform might not be a bad thing No I don t mean a plaid skirt and collared top \u00e0 la Catholic schoolgirl but a general schema for how you dress every day Contrary to popular myth a uniform is not a sign of a lack of individuality or a lack of creativity After all Jacqueline Kennedy was known for her pillbox hats and tailored suits in the sixties Alexander Wang loves his cotton t shirts and dapper sneakers and Karl Lagerfeld is never without a sharp tie and a pair of black sunglasses Having a personal uniform saves time and relieves stress in the mornings and gives you a signature look that others will remember you by Tips for Creating Maintaining a Personal UniformCreating a personal uniform for yourself appears to be a daunting task at first but can save you time and gain you a lot of attention in the long run Start with these simple steps and work your way into slightly less stressful mornings and dashing style Take photos Invest in a Polaroid camera or just use the self timer on your digital camera to take photographs of your outfits in order to figure out what you like and don t like Figure out what your signature accessories are and stick with them Do you always wear a strand of pearls around your neck Do you have thirty pairs of tights and stockings that you always wear with skirts or dresses Make sure you have enough varieties of your signature piece to last you all week whether it s a collection of patent leather heels or giant cocktail rings Even if you decide to mix and match the rest of your outfit a signature item will reduce the time spent accessorizing and completing your outfit in the morning Make guidelines for each piece while still leaving a lot of flexibility into your uniform You can easily do this by naming or categorizing each component of your uniform for example a structured blazer an A line dress or straight jeans A structured blazer ensures that you re picking something work appropriate but is open to interpretation think about it what does structured exactly mean at the same time Choose your uniform components based on what looks best on you That includes only wearing trends that look good on you You re much less likely to change your entire style or wardrobe if you are already wearing what looks best on you Organize your closet and drawers based on pieces instead of colors or seasons That way even if you re half awake in the morning you can choose an outfit efficiently without frantically searching for a peacoat Think investment not disposable Disposable fast fashion can be fun but investing in high quality unique or classic pieces will eventually save you time and money That doesn t mean you need to sell your kidney in order to buy the latest Alexander McQueen collection but it does mean you should buy pieces that you know will last you a long time and that you will wear for a long time whether it s a pencil skirt from H M or a vintage Chanel 2 55 purse Having a personal uniform doesn t have to be dry at all It s time efficient consistently interesting and conceptually unique so you can spend less time rummaging through your closet and more time turning heads as you stride to work or school Looking for more inspiration Check out Sheena Matheiken on The Uniform Project where she wears the same dress every day for an entire year raising money for The Akanksha Foundation What do you think Do you have a personal uniform and if so what does it look like Also do you have any other tips for creating a personal uniform Tell us with a

Copious Wednesday February 23 2011 Posted by Elegantly Wasted When it comes to heavy jackets and trendy practical outer wear these British pioneers of fashion couldn t do it much better Although despite forever being in my top five favorite labels I was slightly off put by the boys use of tartan this season I m unsure as to what it is that I don t really like about tartan possibly the memory of myself running around in a tartan pleated mini skirt at age fourteen dreaming of being some kind of punk rock chick or the fact that I continue to have a love hate relationship with red clothing on my pale complexion These personal issues with red tartan aside however it would be wrong to say that they haven t done tartan well The use of tartan red and royal blue pays homage to the boys British roots in a way that is uniquely Rag and Bone The use of such milky light colours juxtaposed with bold red and blue hues in New York s darkest season also challenges the traditional New Yorker s all black winter wardrobe that so many designer s tend to favor Some key pieces in the collection including the leather bomber jacket and thin shaggy fur jackets offered a practical alternative to leather biker s and coats while the duo s use of heavy layering continued to remain one of the collections key themes The dark eye makeup and messy loosely braided hair also helped to keep each look effortless despite the complexity of the layering And although there was little attention paid of accessorizing the thin golden chain necklaces proved enough to make all of the difference Source Style

leather and sparkling pants aside the first thing I noticed about Wang s fall collection was the absence of some of his favorite faces Unlike in his previous shows there was no Abbey or Freja but Hanne Karmen and Liu Wen still remained three of Wang s favorite faces However this wasn t the only visible change or growth in Wang s fall collection After the rapid expansion of his T label Wang sought to create a strong point of different between his high end and lower end labels through his use of such fabrics as angora chiffon and silk making this fall collection the definition of luxurious chic And whilst being somewhat luxurious the traditional leather biker pipe thin pants and angora coats all continue to reflect his traditional model off duty aesthetic As for the accessories they were few and far between which wasn t overly surprising given the copious layers one wears in fall Although there s always the shoes The pointy brogue esque metallic heels paired with the pink royal blue and charcoal sparkling pants are my favorite I can t say the same for the fur heels in deep red however which looked more like high end slippers to me rather than something I d be rocking with my jeans next winter But all in all there s not much else worth complaining about It s undeniably exciting to have Wang back in black Source Style com Tuesday February 15 2011 Posted by

Google Lara Bingle and Brendan Fevola if you re in need of a catch up I had almost forgotten that Lara Bingle is actually a model I don t think I can think of one occasion where I have seen her in a magazine that I read so I was quite taken back by her latest cover and editorial yes cover AND editorial for Issue 91 of Oyster It would almost be crude of me to not give her some credit for this editorial which is surprisingly fresh and well I like it Although I couldn t help but notice that Bingle upon first thought doesn t really fit the Oyster mould Despite being a face that you would see in other Australian publications such as Vogue and Harpers Bazaar I hardly see Bingle as kill me for using this word alternative Put simply Oyster is a far more independent and artistic magazine than those of which you would probably see Bingle in And even then you d probably see her in the social pages even rather than an editorial but still equally as likely to be wearing that new season patent Burberry biker At the same time however the sense is there Or in the changes of editors at Oyster this month As Bingle takes her stand and makes a comeback Oyster welcomes a new editorial director

she d watch Regis Kathie Lee religiously she even once went to a shopping mall somewhere on Long Island to get Kathie Lee Gifford to sign a copy of her book These days she and my dad Tivo Regis and Kelly in the morning and watch it at night I m a View man myself though Whoopie is no Rosie I miss the compulsively watchable hysteria of Rosie vs Elizabeth but once I went to a taping of Regis Kathie Lee almost ten years ago because my friend Dana was Harrison Ford obsessed and he was the featured guest Why am I telling you all this Because if you d asked me last week Who are the last two people you d expect to have the key to unlock the mysteries of one of New York s greatest cookies I would not have said Regis Philbin and Kelly Ripa And yet thanks to this post on Eater New York it became evident last week that if I wanted to make Momofuku Milk Bar s compost cookies at home the recipe was right there on Regis Kelly s webpage For those not in the know and for those who missed this post two weeks ago the Momofuku Milk Bar compost cookie created by genius pastry chef Christina Tosi is an explosively rich and buttery cookie packed with the most unexpected flavors pretzels potato chips Rice Krispies and chocolate Somehow all those flavors and calories work together to produce an unforgettable cookie one that when you eat it at the actual location makes you think to yourself I could never make it this good at home But you can thank you Reeg It s actually pretty easy a traditional chocolate chip cookie recipe with one unexpected step Normally when you make chocolate chip cookies like my favorite ones here you beat together the butter and sugar you add eggs and combine then add the dry ingredients and finally the chocolate Here that middle step combining the butter the sugar and the eggs goes on for ten minutes You let it whip on medium high speed and the batter becomes intensely pale and takes on a glossy sheen It s kind of incredible Then after that you add your dry ingredients and then the wacky stuff I was conservative this first time around adding only crushed pretzels and chocolate But these cookies were such a hit in fact my neighbor Rob the Culinary Cardiologist said and I don t believe him but he said it I m not making this up These are almost slightly better than the ones I ate last week at the actual Momofuku Milk Bar I know What a nut Don t listen to him he s crazy that I feel bold enough to experiment further next time around I m definitely adding potato chips Now those of you nowhere near New York can experience the Momofuku Milk Bar compost cookie phenomenon yourselves At 9 AM tomorrow morning you know who to thank The Momofuku Milk Bar Compost Cookierecipe by Christina Tosi Courtesy of Regis Kelly s website Ingredients 1 cup butter that s two sticks unsalted 1 cup granulated sugar3 4 cup light brown sugar1 Tbsp corn syrup Note I left this out not because I m against corn syrup I just didn t have it The cookies came out fine though may have had a nicer sheen with the syrup 1 tsp vanilla extract2 large eggs1 3 4 cups all purpose flour2 tsps baking powder1 tsp baking soda2 tsps Kosher salt1 1 2 cups your favorite baking ingredients options chocolate chips Raisenettes Rollos Cocoa Krispies 1 1 2 cups your favorite snack foods chips pretzels etc Note as said above I used chopped up bittersweet chocolate and crushed pretzels Next time I d definitely add potato chips 1 In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment cream butter sugars and corn syrup on medium high for two to three minutes until fluffy and pale yellow in color Scrape down the sides with a spatula 2 On a lower speed add eggs and vanilla to incorporate Increase mixing speed to medium high and start a timer for 10 minutes During this time the sugar granules will fully dissolve the mixture will become an almost pale white color and your creamed mixture will double in size 3 When time is up on a lower speed add the flour baking powder baking soda and salt Mix 45 60 seconds just until your dough comes together and all remnants of dry ingredients have incorporated Do not walk away from your mixer during this time or you will risk over mixing the dough Scrape down the sides of the mixing bowl with a spatula 4 On the same low speed add in the hodgepodge of your favorite baking ingredients and mix for 30 45 seconds until they evenly mix into the dough Add in your favorite snack foods last paddling again on low speed until they are just incorporated Note eating this cookie dough raw is dangerously good 5 Using a 6 oz ice cream scoop I m not sure how many ounces mine is but it worked well portion cookie dough onto a parchment lined sheetpan 6 Wrap scooped cookie dough tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for a minimum of one hour or up to 1 week DO NOT BAKE your cookies from room temperature or they will not hold their shape 7 Heat the oven to 400 F Take the plastic off your cookies and bake 9 to 11 minutes While in the oven the cookies will puff crackle and spread At 9 minutes the cookies should be browned on the edges and just beginning to brown towards the center Leave the cookies in the oven for the additional minutes if these colors don t match up and your cookies still seem pale and doughy on the surface 8 Cool the cookies completely on the sheet pan good luck before transferring to a plate or an airtight container or tin for storage At room temp they ll keep five days  my mom loves regis philbin. growing up, she'd watch regis & kathie lee religiously; she even once went to a shopping mall,

breakfast treats but after tasting these muffins I think I may be doing it more often I adapted a recipe from Annie s Eats a great food blog for everything from appetizers to dessert and found a recipe that caught my eye These muffins were great for not only breakfast but they also made for a satisfying dessert with a scoop of icecream While I found the recipe on Annie s Eats the muffin recipe originally comes from Williams Sonoma and was exactly what I was looking for in a muffin The recipe made about 10 muffins and the batter came together very quickly After baking the end result yeilded golden muffins with a crisp topping gently covering their light and fluffy texture The light and tender crumb is thanks to the use of buttermilk in the batter As noted I opted to use a basic crumb topping instead of dipping the muffins into melted butter and then into a cinnamon sugar topping as called for in the original muffin recipe and I am more than pleased with the results Besides who needs a muffin dipped in melted butter The muffin itself has a slightly sweet and subtle cinnamon flavor and bakes up with a moist tender and fluffy crumb I felt it was a nice contrast to the sweet brown sugar and cinnamon crumb streusel that gives the muffins a crisp top and gorgeous appearance sure to impress company if needed Next time I may add some chopped toasted walnuts to the batter or the topping for a little extra flavor punch I would highly recommend these the next time you have some buttermilk to use up or are just looking for an easy and flavorful muffin recipe I rate

"http://www.emedexpert.com/tips/brain.shtml"	"5993"	"{""title"":""How To Boost Brain Power and Memory "",""body"":""Until just a few years ago doctors believed that the brain stopped making new neural connections meaning that the memory began to get irreversibly worse when the body stopped developing usually in the early 20s And doctors knew that like any other part of the body neurons weaken as people age Loss of brain function due to neural breakdown was assumed to be a normal unavoidable part of aging It turns out they were wrong In the past few years it has become clear that you can in fact make new neurons starting in your 20s and continuing well into old age You can literally rewire the brain with new parts as the older parts wear out How There are lots of things you can do right now to preserve protect and enhance your gray matter 1Physical exercise A healthy body really does mean a healthy mind In the last decade it became clear that regular exercise beneficially affects brain function Exercise boosts brain power by stimulating formation of new brain cells neurons the process known as neurogenesis2 Also exercise strengthens connections between those cells Researchers have found the areas of the brain that are stimulated through exercise are associated with memory and learning1 Physical exercise may even help prevent Alzheimer s disease Several studies7 9 have confirmed that regular physical activity reduces the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in old age 2Lifelong learning your brain is a learning machine For most of us after we graduate from high school or college our pursuit of new knowledge bottoms out over time We may be masters at what we do but we aren t learning new things There is clear evidence10 11 that education and learning produce favourable changes in the brain Researchers believe that intellectual activity play a neuroprotective role against dementia Some studies suggest that having a low level of formal education and poor linguistic skills is a risk factor for cognitive decline in later life But if you continue to learn and challenge yourself your brain continues to grow literally Recent research12 have demonstrated that learning over time enhances memory and the survival of new brain cells An active brain produces new connections between nerve cells that allow cells to communicate with one another This helps your brain store and retrieve information more easily no matter what your age How can you challenge yourself Scientists agree that anything that is new and expands your knowledge will be effective Learning to play a musical instrument Switching careers or starting a new one Starting a new hobby such as crafts painting biking or bird watching Learning a foreign language According to the latest study speaking more than one language may slow the aging process in the mind Staying informed about what s going on in the world Learning to cook new dish If you let your brain be idle it s not going to be in the best health 3Mental stimulation Researchers found that a woman s memory can be impaired for at least a year after giving birth although the effects are minor Stimulate your brain Make sure you re actively problem solving and having to use your memory Just as physical activity keeps your body strong mental activity keeps your mind sharp and agile The more we think the better our brains function regardless of age Without something to keep us mentally charged our brains like unused muscles can atrophy leading to a decline in cognitive abilities The study6 conducted by researchers at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York found that mentally active seniors reduced their risk of dementia by as much as 75 percent compared to those who do not stimulate their minds Researchers from the Princeton University13 found that simple cognitive stimulation such as Bingo can be of great value to the daily management of Alzheimer s patients Some good ways to stimulate your mind Travel Going to museums Reading books newspapers or magazines Play thinking games like cards checkers chess crosswords sudoku puzzles Scrabble or doing crossword puzzles Playing musical instruments Dancing Crafts such as drawing painting and ceramics Ditch the calculator once in while and forcing yourself to do the calculation Volunteering 4Social interaction People are good medicine Social interaction can be measured by how often people talk on the phone with friends neighbors and relatives how often they get together with them how many people they can share their most private feelings and concerns with Men are one and a half times more likely than women to develop mild cognitive impairment the transition stage before dementia new research shows Socializing may have a protective effect on the brain because it s a form of mental exercise Not only does interacting with people stimulate the brain but it can also keep you sharp because dealing with people can be pretty challenging Strong social ties have been associated with lower blood pressure and longer life expectancies And having no social ties is believed to be an independent risk factor for cognitive decline in older persons A U S team found14 that talking to another person for 10 minutes a day improves memory and test scores They found that socializing was just as effective as more traditional kinds of mental exercise in boosting memory and intellectual performance They also found that the higher the level of social interaction the better the cognitive functioning Social interaction included getting together or having phone chats with relatives friends and neighbors In a study of more than 2 800 people ages 65 or older Harvard researchers15 found that those with at least five social ties church groups social groups regular visits or phone calls with family and friends were less likely to suffer cognitive decline than those with no social ties 5Sleep Nap Sleep plays a crucial role in brain development and growth One of the explanations the science has come up with for the healing power of sleep is that sleep may contribute to neurogenesis the formation of new nerve cells in the brain16 New research in animals17 provides a clue about how the sleep deprivation harm the brains reduces the number of new brain cells Without sufficient sleep neurons may not have time to repair all the damage and so could malfunction during the day Sleep is necessary for the brain to process and consolidate knowledge and for memories to form Neuroscientists say that during sleep the hippocampus where memory is stored becomes highly active and moves knowledge from short term memory to long term memory18 19 The memories laid down by the sleeping brain are of two kinds Declarative memory is memory for information facts dates and names Procedural memory is what allows us to do things like play a musical instrument ride a bicycle or add up a bill Scientists think these two types of memory are influenced by different parts of the sleep cycle Slow wave sleep benefit mainly the consolidation of declarative memories In contrast rapid eye movement REM sleep seems to benefit procedural memory20 A 45 minute midday nap can help boost your memory and remember facts but only if you learned them well in the first place5 According to animal studies when you perform a task the brain cells fire in a certain sequence If you then fall asleep the same cells automatically fire in an identical sequence without being distracted or disrupted by incoming visual stimuli There is a consistent pattern Learn something new during the day consolidate what you have learned during a good night s sleep then remember or perform the task better in the morning However sleep before learning is also critical in preparing the brain for next day memory formation21 Even a nap in the middle of the day may benefit some learning according to a recent study5 Sleep appears to help set the declarative memories and make them easier to recall 6Stress management The brain uses 20 percent of our body s oxygen and 20 percent of its blood Scientists believe people exposed to chronic stress tend to have elevated levels of cortisol a hormone produced by the adrenal glands in response to acute and chronic stress High cortisol levels are dangerous to the brain Some of the most impressive effects of the stress on brain are hippocampus atrophy shrinkage of the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex the area of the brain unique to humans and even neural death in some brain regions24 28 The hippocampus a vital brain region for episodic spatial and contextual memory has many cortisol receptors which makes it especially susceptible to stress Severe stress lasting weeks or months can impair cell communication in the brain s learning and memory region27 Increased stress hormones lead to memory impairment in the elderly and learning difficulties in young adults26 Latest study provides the evidence that short term stress has the same effect Researcher from the University of California25 have found short term stress lasting as little as a few hours can impair brain cell communication in areas associated with learning and memory They found that rather than involving the widely known stress hormone cortisol which circulates throughout the body acute stress activated selective molecules called corticotropin releasing hormones which disrupted the process by which the brain collects and stores memories Stress is a constant in our lives and cannot be avoided So stress management is the key not stress elimination Several ways to help you manage stress in your daily life See problems as opportunities Get away from the noise Exercise Learn relaxation techniques such as yoga and meditation Cut down on unnecessary responsibilities and avoid over scheduling Make time for leisure activities Get a massage 7Laugh Humor Laughter is the best medicine We ve heard the expression time and again Medical world has begun to take more serious notice of the healing power of humor and the positive emotions associated with it By having fun and laughing your stress levels decrease significantly Humor stimulates the parts of our brain that use the feel good chemical messenger dopamine41 Also researchers found that humor improves memory39 40 8Healthy breakfast It might be the last thing on your morning to do list or it might not be on your list at all However many studies have shown that having breakfast improves the ability of concentration reaction time learning ability mood and memory whereas skipping breakfast reduces people s performance at school and at work42 43 A recent study done at Cardiff University in Wales found that subjects who ate a high fiber cereal in the morning showed a 10 percent reduction in fatigue lower incidence of depression and better cognitive skills Fiber helps slow down the absorption of food in the stomach so you have more energy for a longer period of time 9Omega 3 fatty acids High intake of omega 6 rich oils such as sunflower or grape seed oil may boost the risk of developing memory problems say French researchers4 Omega 3 fatty acids are essential for brain health they provide the physical building blocks necessary for the development and maintenance of the structural and functional integrity of the brain In fact one of the omega 3 fatty acids commonly known as DHA docosahexaenoic acid makes up a large portion of the gray matter in the brain and is vital for brain cells function Adding more DHA to your brain directly influences cell to cell communication affects nerve conduction and neurotransmitter release and other things that allow brain cells to send messages to each other29 One 1999 review of studies on DHA published in the journal Pharmacological Research32 found that the nutrient is essential to normal brain function and that a diet rich in DHA improves learning while a lack of DHA causes learning ability to suffer French researchers4 looked at the diets of 8 085 people older than 65 who did not have dementia at the start of the study Over the following four years 183 of the participants developed Alzheimer s disease and 98 developed another form of dementia People who regularly consumed omega 3 rich oils such as canola flaxseed and walnut oil were 60 percent less likely to develop dementia than those who did not regularly consume such oils The study also found that regular consumption of fruits and vegetables lowered dementia risk by 30 percent People who ate fish at least once a week were 40 percent less likely to develop dementia Coldwater fish such as salmon tuna mackerel and herring are rich sources of omega 3 fatty acids just be careful to eat this in moderation due to potential contamination with mercury Dutch studies30 31 revealed that high fish consumption may reduce the risk of dementia and cognitive decline 10Blueberries Would you believe that eating this tasty low glycemic superfood every day was found by the USDA at Tufts University33 35 to slow and even reverse age related brain decline as well as improve short term memory loss and help reverse age related loss of balance Blueberries are a major source of flavonoids in particular anthocyanins and flavanols Although the precise mechanisms by which these plant derived molecules affect the brain are unknown they have been shown to cross the blood brain barrier after dietary intake It is believed that they exert their effects on learning and memory by enhancing existing neuronal connections improving cellular communications and stimulating neuronal regeneration 11Vegetables Researchers found that eating vegetables appears to help keep the brain young and may slow the mental decline sometimes associated with growing old22 Cruciferous and green leafy vegetables including cauliflower spinach kale broccoli cabbage brussels sprout and collards appear to be the most beneficial23 Researchers say that may be because they contain healthy amounts of vitamin E an antioxidant that is believed to help fight chemicals produced by the body that can damage cells Three B vitamins folic acid B6 and B12 can help lower your homocysteine levels Fortified cereal other grains and leafy green vegetables are good sources of B vitamins 12Want to drink Choose red wine People who drink to forget bad memories may actually be doing the opposite by reinforcing the neural circuits that control negative emotional memory3 While heavy drinking clearly causes serious problems for many people drinking in moderation may be good for the brain Researchers found intake of up to three daily servings of wine unlike other alcohol beverages liquor beer was associated with a lower risk of dementia37 This may be due to the ability of red wine polyphenols to protect brain cells against alcohol induced damage38 There is well documented evidence that resveratrol a polyphenol found in red wine and red grape skin and seeds has a significant antioxidant properties and produces neuroprotective effects36 13Keep health problems under control Many medical conditions particularly those identified as risk factors for cardiovascular disease are also risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia High blood pressureHigh blood pressure in midlife increases the risk of cognitive decline in old age44 Use lifestyle modification to lower your blodd pressure DiabetesDiabetes is an important risk factor for dementia45 You can improve blood glucose levels by eating healthy diet exercising regularly and staying lean But if your blood sugar stays high you ll need medication to achieve good control High cholesterolHigh levels of LDL bad cholesterol appear to significantly increase the risk of dementia46 Diet exercise weight control and avoiding tobacco will go a long way toward improving your cholesterol levels High homocysteineResearch has shown that a higher than average blood level of homocysteine a type of amino acid is a strong risk factor for the development of Alzheimer disease and dementia47 14Neurobics Created by Lawrence C Katz Ph D a professor of neurobiology at Duke University Medical Center neurobics is a unique system of brain exercises using your five physical senses and your emotional sense in unexpected ways that encourage you to shake up your everyday routines Studies have shown that even small changes in daily patterns cause brain stimulation Neurobics can be done anywhere anytime in offbeat fun and easy ways These exercises can activate underused nerve pathways and connections helping you achieve a fit and flexible mind Drive to work a different route Get dressed with your eyes closed Brush your teeth with the other hand Unlock the door with your eyes closed Use your opposite hand to dial the phone or operate the TV remote Listen to music and smell flowers at the same time Shop at new grocery store Research has suggested that using your left hand if you re left handed or your right if you re left handed more often can help stimulate parts of the brain that you don t normally use Sources References 1 Wu CW Chen YC Yu L Chen HI Jen CJ

wise words from our mother we re constantly bombarded with tips to keep our health in check But before drowning in diet soda and daily showers reassess some of these behaviors that may be doing more harm than help Foods and eating habits 1 Enhanced water A little faux fruity flavor might seem like a great way to up H2O intake but flavored water like Vitamin Water or even Smart Water can be filled with sugar Skip the artificially sweetened water and infuse water with actual fruit 2 Granola and granola bars Granola is made from whole grains so it can t be bad right Not so fast Granola and granola bars are both calorically dense and often contain a ton of sugar You may as well eat a candy bar 3 Protein bars Protein bars don t fall far from the granola bar tree They are often ultra high in calories and sugar not exactly what the body needs after a hard workout Choose a healthier high protein snack instead 4 Vitamins and supplements Multiple studies have shown that taking vitamins in pill form may not have any positive effect on long term health Researchers have surveyed the nonexistent or even potentially harmful ties of vitamin E and C supplements with heart disease cancer and cancer treatment Plus most people get all the vitamins they need from their food and substituting pills for whole foods may mean missing out on the benefits from other compounds found in the natural sources 5 Light beer News flash Light beer doesn t necessarily mean less calories Instead many simply have a lower alcohol content And for those interested in getting a buzz on the calorie difference may be negated by the need to drink more Sip a healthier beer instead and split up the six pack between friends 6 Low fat foods Think twice before skipping the fat filled salmon While cutting some fat could help weight loss we may miss out on some big benefits from healthy omega 3 fats such as boosting brainpower and lowering the risk of heart disease 7 Skipping meals Skipping meals probably won t save us any calories in the long haul Forgoing a meal may result in overeating later on so choose a healthier lunchtime treat instead 8 Bottled water Some bottled water may be filled with bacteria or chemicals when bottled in plastic containers So grab a water filter and purify tap water instead 9 Passing on dessert Don t deny your favorite dessert If really craving that double chocolate brownie enjoy a few generous bites instead of going for seconds at the dinner buffet line which could rack up even more calories 10 Diet soda Diet Dr Pepper may not be our friend Scientists suggest too much of these zero cal beverages could do as much damage as the sugary stuff potentially leading to weight gain and an uncontrollable sweet tooth The solution Skip the soda completely and opt for a healthier choice 11 Juice diets Many of us could use a few more fruits and veggies but we don t need to have spinach apple juice for breakfast lunch and dinner Juice diets may leave out important nutrients and enough calories to stay strong throughout the day 12 Microwave diet meals Try making your own meals without the box and frozen plastic tray Many frozen meals are packed with sodium while lacking veggies and enough calories Short on time Make a large batch of your favorite meal over the weekend and freeze individual portions to eat throughout the week Hygiene and health 13 Hot tubs They may be super relaxing but hot tubs are a one stop shop for bacteria and germs and may even cause a rash Gross 14 Antibacterial soap It may not be worth scrubbing down with the fancy stuff Regular soap and water is just as beneficial when it comes to staying squeaky clean 15 Brushing right after every meal Just cause dessert was devoured doesn t mean we should grab the toothbrush and paste Wait at least 30 minutes after a meal so saliva can neutralize the acid in the mouth and strengthen the enamel on those chompers 16 Avoiding the sun While too much sun could cause a nasty burn or worse sidestepping the sun at all costs may lead to a lack of Vitamin D which is essential for proper muscle and bone development 17 Daily showers Stop the scrubbing Hopping in the shower too often may irritate and dry out skin If you really need to freshen up spray on some perfume or cologne and save the shower till tomorrow 18 Catching up on sleep We re sorry to break it to you but it s pretty tricky to catch up on sleep So rather than skimping on sleep in order to cash them in later aim for a solid seven to nine hours a night 19 Sitting up straight Yeah we re surprised too Sitting up straight may be bad for the back so skip the seat and try a standing desk at the office 20 Cleaning with disinfecting products There s some evidence that certain chemicals in disinfecting products could lead to asthma Simply use a regular cleaning product or detergent without the chemicals instead Working out 21 Only doing cardio Hitting the roads is great and all but don t retire the weights for the running shoes Make sure to strength train to burn fat lean out and look badass in the process 22 Doing a million crunches The secret to six pack abs probably isn t crunch after crunch To flatten out and tone up the core try running some intervals lifting a few weights and cleaning up that diet instead 23 Breathing deeply through the chest Whether running the final lap or heading down the basketball court avoid deep breathing with the chest For a most effective breath to help any athlete s performance remember to use the diaphragm 24 Static stretching pre workout When warming up static stretching aka holding positions for a certain length of time won t do much in way of preventing soreness Skip the still motions and do dynamic stretches like lunges and high knees instead 25 Lifting machines Most lifting machines focus on single joint exercises which fail to improve muscle imbalance and does not burn as many calories as hitting the squat rack or swinging a kettlebell 26 Hitting the gym daily Don t get us wrong exercise is important But spending too much time at the gym leaves little time for muscles and the mind to recover Make sure to get at least one or two days of rest and dominate those dumbbells the rest of the week getty images from magazine headlines to wise words from our mother, we're constantly bombarded with \""tips\"" to keep our health in check. but

"http://www.naturalnews.com/022040.html"	"2590"	"{""title"":""How to Buy Organic Apples comic how to buy organic apples (comic)"",""body"":""See all CounterThink cartoons These days it seems increasingly difficult to know what to shop for at the grocery store Is organic always better than conventional What if it s an organic product that s been flown half way around the world burning up fossil fuels that contribute to global warming How do you decide what s better A conventional apple grown locally with chemical pesticides or an organic apple from another continent This cartoon depicts a common conundrum among consumers How do you decide which grocery products are best for not just your own personal health but also the health of the planet It s a more complex decision than it might first seem For one thing much of the information necessary to make an informed decision simply isn t available to consumers There is not determined enforcement of the rule for example that foods are accurately labeled with their country of origin Nor is there any requirement to disclose which foods were grown with pesticides herbicides or other chemicals banned in the United States and U K but still legal in other places like Central and South America If that last sentence surprises you it should not one in a hundred American consumers is aware that it is perfectly legal for U S chemical companies to export dangerous chemical pesticides like DDT that have been banned for use on crops in the United States Those pesticides are sold to countries with lower environmental and health standards which turn around and use them on crops that are exported right back to the USA So U S consumers end up eating produce grown with the very same pesticides banned in the United States and it s all perfectly legal and openly accepted by the Food and Drug Administration and U S Department of Agriculture In the U S there s also the issue of so called illegal immigrants which I believe to be a strange term since in my opinion there s no such thing as an illegal human being On one hand U S consumers demand cheap produce that can only be grown and harvested with the help of illegal immigrant labor On the other hand Americans grumble about too many Mexicans migrating into California Arizona New Mexico and Texas claiming they are stealing jobs and bankruptcing cities and states And yet not surprisingly when most consumers have a choice between a 3 apple grown on a farm that pays legal wages to U S workers and a 1 apple grown on a farm that pays illegal wages to an undocumented worker from Mexico most Americans will choose the 1 apple and in doing so they are in fact continuing to vote for the very illegal immigration they claim to oppose Making an informed produce purchasing decision at the grocery store it turns out is nearly impossible these days There s no way to know where the food came from what soils it was grown in the immigration status of those who harvested it and which chemicals were used on it And to make matters worse powerful food corporations are constantly trying to water down the definition of organic to include the agricultural use of obscene substances such as raw human sewage Fortunately that was not ultimately allowed under the organic label but the food companies tried to sneak it in The only way to truly know where your food comes from is to know your local farmers When you know the people growing your food and you can meet them face to face then you know what you re getting That s why I m a huge supporter of CSAs Community Supported Agriculture farmers markets backyard gardening and local food co ops Through organizations like these consumers can maintain close relationships with the people who grow their food and farmers are able to exercise far greater control over what they grow how they grow it and how much they get paid for it Large commercial food companies like ADM would prefer that farmers remain isolated from consumers They want all the food processing to go through them first where they set the prices and conditions that farmers are forced to accept Other corporations have used intellectual property control over genetically modified seeds to threaten farmers who are refusing to adopt their pesticide ready crop varieties It s all part of a plan to control the global food supply an endeavor that inevitably destroys local farming as well as agricultural biodiversity which leaves crops susceptible to future wipeouts from infectious disease Sure these companies can produce a nice round shiny apple at the grocery store for an unbelievably low price but at what cost to the world The existence of that apple is based on numerous inputs that may be highly detrimental to the health of the planet as a whole The burning of fossil fuels for farming and transportation the use of chemical pesticides that wash downstream and poison aquatic ecosystems the use of artificial fertilizers that lack real soil nutrition the destruction of microbial life in agricultural soils the loss of biodiversity and the subsequent decline in wildlife populations and so on When you look at an apple you re really looking at an historical account of everything that happened to bring you that apple The whole story is written into that apple There s the intention of the people involved with producing that apple the health of the soils the use of chemicals or not on the apple the impact on the environment and much more An organic locally farmed apple from a small family farm tells a very different story Respect for nature positive intention healthful soils humility in nature connection with plants and animals biodiversity minimal use of fossil fuels and so on This is the kind of apple I d like to eat how about you Now here s the real kicker in all this When you eat an apple you absorb and assimilate the story that went into creating that apple So eating an organic locally grown consciously harvested apple gives you not only nourishment and biochemical nutrition it also gives you the positive energy of abundance humility harmony and happiness A conventionally grown apple on the other hand is more likely to give you the story of greed desperation depletion fear and disease Is that the energy you want circulating in your veins An apple you see is made of much more than its chemical constituents All fruits and vegetables have water and water stores emotional energy passing it on to those who consume the water Since an apple is probably something like 75 water by volume eating an apple is actually an exercise in chewing mostly on water Aren t you curious to know what kind of energy and intention is in that water You should be Because beyond the vitamins minerals and phytonutrients in the apple the water impacts your body mind and spirit more than anything else And one of the reasons we see so much obesity in America today is because people are eating empty lifeless food products that provide only calories but no energetic nourishment The food is mostly an empty shell lifeless and devoid of positive vibration and then they cook it irradiate it and process it even more to give it shelf life For the most part the food isn t being grown harvested and sold at a high enough vibration to end the cravings human beings have for nourishment at all levels physical emotional and spiritual The food being sold today is missing something and if you want complete food that s nourishing at all levels I strongly recommend you grow it yourself or work with local farmers who you know are passionate about cooperating with nature to maximize abundance for themselves and those around them Permissions to use Want to use this cartoon Specific limited

almost all of the classic Chinese American dishes chow mein wonton soup cashew chicken etc When I told her I was planning on pulling together a few recipes for Chinese New Year to post on the blog she insisted that this dish had to be on the menu As she put it this is the type of Chinese food that everybody loves As hard as it is to admit I too am fairly partial to a good take out box of broccoli beef every once in a while Sure I have a few Chinese friends that scoff at the very notion of this dish as a truly authentic Chinese dish but the fact of the matter is this is good simple comfort food at its best Making good broccoli beef at home is way easier than most people think In fact with a few Asian ingredients that all home chefs should have in their pantry and about a pound of good flank steak the average home cook can have an outstanding dish on their table in less than a half hour Simply follow the principles of good stir frying technique and you are pretty much guaranteed solid results Make this dish After you see how easy it is to put together you might just reconsider paying 9 10 for it at a restaurant the next time you get that craving BROCCOLI BEEF Adapted from Jaden Hair s Recipe at Simply Recipes Blanching the broccoli before adding it to the pan ensures that each floret will be perfectly cooked in your final dish as it would never have the chance to fully cook given the brief frying period in this recipe As with all blanching of vegetables do so in a very large pot of well salted water and have your ice bath ready and waiting When it comes time to stir fry the beef make sure your pan is ripping hot Once the beef has been added don t touch it I like there to be a good amount of caramelization taking place on the meat during this initial sear and you will not be able to induce much browning if you are constantly stirring the contents of the pan Considering how drastic the difference in salt levels can be among certain brands of soy sauce and oyster sauce taste the sauce before adding it to the pan and adjust accordingly If you find the sauce a bit too salty try adding a few pinches of sugar to balance out the flavor INGREDIENTS 3 4 pound flank steak thinly sliced against the grain 3 4 pound broccoli florets 2 tablespoons peanut grapeseed or vegetable oil 2 cloves garlic finely minced 1 teaspoon cornstarch dissolved in 1 tablespoon water For the Marinade 1 teaspoon soy sauce 1 teaspoon Chinese rice wine or dry sherry 1 2 teaspoon cornstarch 1 8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper For the Sauce 2 tablespoons oyster sauce 1 teaspoon Chinese rice wine or dry sherry 1 tablespoon light soy sauce 1 4 cup chicken broth 1 4 teaspoon toasted sesame oil Sugar to taste METHOD Marinate the Beef Stir together the beef marinade ingredients in a medium bowl Add in the slices of beef and stir until well coated Set aside at room temperature for at least 10 minutes Make the Sauce Stir together the sauce ingredients in a small bowl until well combined Set aside Blanch the Broccoli Cook the broccoli florets in a large pot of well salted boiling water for 1 to 2 minutes or until crisp tender Using a slotted spoon remove the broccoli from the boiling water and shock the florets immediately in ice water to stop the cooking process Drain well dry and set aside Make the Broccoli Beef Heat the 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet or wok over set over high heat until shimmering and just starting to smoke Add the marinated beef to the pan in a single layer making sure that each pieces lays flat against the bottom for maximum surface contact Let the beef fry for 1 minutes without turning or flipping Turn the beef over add the garlic to the pan and allow to fry for another 30 seconds or until no longer pink Stir the contents of the pan and pour in the sauce add the blanched broccoli and bring to a boil Add the dissolved cornstarch liquid and simmer until slightly thickened about 30 more seconds Take the pan off

"http://www.theparsleythief.com/"	"6355"	"{""title"":""the parsley thief the parsley thief"",""body"":""One of my favorite pastimes that s not food related per se is to peruse design and crafting blogs I love design as I ve mentioned many times before but I also love anything crafty Unfortunately most of the time the farthest I get is just looking at crafty things because I don t have a whole lot of free time for the task of actually executing anything This year s Valentine project is a perfect case in point Before anyone starts freaking out about how cute this Valentine is and yes I think it s cute too it wasn t my idea I saw this 3D lollipop Valentine on Design Mom originally from the blog 24 7 365 two years ago I bookmarked it intending to make some with my Bozos but as typically happens I ran out of time and was forced to run to the drug store and buy some Valentines in a box Last year it seemed that many people had caught wind of this technique because I started seeing it more and more But once again I missed the boat Now with the invention of Pinterest this Valentine has blown up all over the place and finally I set aside the time to make some and share them here I honestly don t know what I was waiting for because one of best things about this project is that it s super easy It literally took us about a half hour to make enough for both my boy s classmates In order to put my own little twist on the idea I decided take some inspiration from the another modern craze and make mine using Instagram along with a couple other iPhone apps Here s a what we did 1 Take the Photo I began by having my boys stand in front of a solid background with one hand outstretched into a fist while I took their picture you can use any background you d like but the less busy the better As far as what kind of camera to use you can use the camera app that comes with your phone the camera function inside of Instagram itself or any other camera app of your choice you could also bag the camera phone route and take your photo using a regular digital camera I took mine using my favorite iPhone camera app Camera I then opened the photo with Instagram to crop the photo into a square add a filter effect and a white border to the photo 2 Add Text to Photo optional I could have done this in Photoshop or another photo editing program like Picnik which happens to be closing in April but can be used until then But I decided to keep things simple and used another iPhone app I love called Labelbox It s a fun and free app that lets you add retro looking labels to your photos After the text was added I uploaded the finished photo to my computer Note you can skip the text part if you d like and have your child write directly on the photo using a Sharpie marker 3 Resize the Photo Depending on what size you d like the finished card to be you can either print out the photos as is or you can resize them and lay them out in a document to make printing out multiples easier We were giving our Valentines tucked inside a goodie bag so I needed them to be relatively small To do this I used Photoshop to resize the original into a 2 1 4 square I then created a 8 1 2 x 11 blank document and laid the small square images out onto the sheet making it possible to print 12 cards out at once 4 Print Trim the Cards You ll need a heavier weight paper for this project as plain copy paper is too flimsy to hold a lollipop Initially I used white cardstock but the photo came out a bit grainy looking which you can see in these photo here It would have been perfectly acceptable as it wasn t too bad but I decided to try a heavy matte photo paper instead and it came out much better perfectly clear and crisp I then used a paper cutter to trim the cards 5 Punch holes in cards assemble Lastly I used a single hole punch to cut holes into the top and bottom of my boy s fists We slid the lollipop sticks through the holes and voila We were done almost You could stop there or you could take it a bit further by tucking the cards inside of some super cute goodie bags like these red chevron striped ones from Pretty Tape We wanted to give a few more candy treats inside so these goodie bags were perfect My boys wrote their classmate s names on strips of washi tape and stuck them to the front of the bags They ve been obsessed with Japanese washi tape for awhile now as have I Pretty Tape also has an amazing selection of tapes if you re interested They finished each bag with a Hersey kiss and a Dove milk chocolate heart I ve never seen them more excited about bringing Valentines to school as they are tonight I hope you enjoy this little tutorial and that you and all your wee ones have a fun day tomorrow Pin It a food blog with step by step cooking tutorials and acclaimed

there are a few things that we can always count on we will make New Year s resolutions boss out and drink top shelf liquor and have to listen to about 50 million end of the year decade countdowns of some sort Well here is 50 000 001 because I fricken love countdowns I have compiled my top 10 list of the top sports movies of the past decade which by the way don t hold a candle to the sports movies of the 90 s Mighty Ducks trilogy enough said But nontheless there have been some noteworthy films throughout the 2000 s Now whilst reading this list there are a couple things you need to keep in mind I am a 21 year old college senior I am not Ebert and Roeper Jeffery Lyons nor am I Gene Shalit I enjoy crude and sophomoric humor as well as awesomely bad films Not all of the movies on my list are going to be highly regarded by the Academy I will not be putting formulaic feel good sports story movies on my list The Hollywood sports movie factory has mass produced some predictable corny films all throughout the 2000 s These films include but are not limited to We Are Marshall The Rookie Gridiron Gang Miracle Glory Road Radio and Coach Carter Without further ado here is the top 10 best films from 2000 2009 10 The Replacements 2000 Loosely based off the 1987 NFL strike it was the story of quarterback Shane Falco played by the brilliant Keanu Reeves getting a second chance in the NFL after choking in the Sugar Bowl in 1996 as a scab during a League strike He led a group of has beens and never was beens to a playoff birth in the final four games of the Washington Sentinals season This movie had it all the wiry foul mouthed cigarette smoking English place kicker the retard strong middle linebacker and the I m so fast but have no hands wide receiver And it even brought back disco with a jail cell Gloria Gaynor song and dance 9 The U 2009 I may be a victim of the moment on this one but this ESPN 30 for 30 documentary about the University of Miami football program was very entertaining This stylish film documented the program and chronicled how they went from giving away free tickets to their games at Burger King to winning four National Championships with three different coaches in a decade All while stealing car stereos and selling cocaine Impressive 8 Remember the Titans 2000 Now I know I said I wouldn t put feel good formula movies on this list but I will give this movie some credit They were the pioneers of this and were what all of the other factory movies modeled themselves after Denzel Washington was great and everyone secretly knew Hayden Panettiere was going to be a stone cold fox And if you were to tell me you have never yelled strong side left side to your buddy on the football field then I will call you a liar 7 Ali 2009 The self titled biopic was in my estimation Will Smith s best performance no disrespect to the Fresh Prince It covered Muhammad Ali s boxing career from 1964 1974 the only part people really care about from his battles with Liston and Frasier his conversion to Islam and The Rumble in the Jungle with the grill man himself Plus the movie gave us every high school s senior graduation song for that year from R Kelly pre pissing on kids 6 Bring It On 2000 Hey Mickey This movie finally shed some light on the cut throat world of competitive cheer and really made us all aware of the years of pain and suffering the inner city squads have had to go through from getting their cheers stolen by the Kirsten Dunst But I feel like we all learned something pretty valuable from Bring It On never hire Sparky Polastri to teach you spirit fingers 5 61 2001 Directed by Yankees die hard Billy Crystal the movie chronicled the 1961 season where Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle were trying to break the Babe s single season home run record They both felt the immense pressure from the race with Maris losing his hair and Mantle shutting it down at the end of the season with a gaping infection on his leg As we all know Maris got to 61 but I would still rather party with Mantle 4 Dodgeball A True Underdog Story 2004 Dodgeball took the popular gym class sport that is all about violence exclusion and degradation and brought it to the silver screen for the first time Patches O Houlihan taught us the five D s of dodgeball Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn gave us quintessential performances all while trying to figure out who Steve the Pirate was This movie will go down as one of the best sports comedies of all time Thank you Chuck Norris 3 Million Dollar Baby 2004 Clint Eastwood directed and starred in this Academy Award winner as a down and out trainer trying to bring an amateur female boxer Hilary Swank to the top It was tough to tell who was more badass Eastwood as his usual grizzled take no shit self or Swank straight knocking bitches out And the narration was done by you guessed it Morgan Freeman That s who I would want to narrate my life story I would give this movie a higher rating but at the end of the day it s still women s boxing which until that movie came out I was unaware was a real sport 2 Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby 2006 The best movie about NASCAR sorry Tom Cruise and possibly Will Ferrell s funniest The movie was pitched to the studio with six simple words Will Ferrell as a NASCAR driver You ve got to love a movie that makes fun of its core demographic and they STILL love it I could easily have a conversation using solely Ricky Bobby movie quotes So thank you six pound eight ounce sweet baby Jesus for letting this movie be made 1 Friday Night Lights 2004 This is in my top five sports movies of all time the story of the 1988 season of the Permian Panthers in the West Texas town of Odessa Friday Night Lights is the antithesis of all the sports movies I hate see above It s a drama about how F ing nuts people are about their football in West Texas and the pressures the players and coaches have to go through Though it was based off a true story I liked how the team lost the championship game it was completely un cliche But does this movie make me want to move to West Texas and become an obsessive high school football dad Kind of Best of the rest Out Cold don t know if it s a sports movie Air Buddies one of the billion sequels in the Air Bud saga Grind Lords of Dogtown Rocky Balboa  devin's take on the sports movies of the past decade with video highlights."",""url"":""detroit4lyfe articles general sports top 10 sports movies of the 2000s html""}"	"?"

International Nutrition International cuisine is more popular than ever in the U S but there are some traditional foods that haven t quite gained the popularity they deserve The nutritious and tasty foods listed here have been part of various cultures around the world for hundreds or thousands of years but it s not too late to hop on the bandwagon Variety is the spice of life 1 Bok Choy Also known as Chinese cabbage bok choy has been cultivated for thousands of years in China It s well known in the Philippines and Korea and it is starting to turn up at grocery stores in North America A cup of bok choy will give you nearly a quarter of the daily recommended amount of calcium over 30 mg of Vitamin C and nearly 3 500 IU of Vitamin A as well as beta carotene folates potassium and even a bit of protein Bok choy is also an excellent source of glucosinolates which preliminary studies show may help prevent some cancers 2 Brown Rice Rice is a staple food in countless cultures around the world but the white rice you typically find in the U S actually has most of its nutritional value removed during processing Brown rice is simply unmilled rice in which only the outermost layer has been removed leaving the bran layer and the germ These are the parts of the rice grain that contain fiber Vitamins B1 and B3 magnesium phosphorus and essential fatty acids In a study done by the American Heart Journal results showed that the nutrients in brown rice helped reduce the buildup of plaque and harmful cholesterol in the blood A study by researchers at Harvard also found that eating brown rice instead of white may help reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes 3 Collard Greens Traditionally a side dish in southern U S cooking collard greens are also found in the cuisines of Portugal Brazil and the Kashmir region Health benefits include its ability to lower cholesterol binds bile acids in the digestive tract An excellent source of vitamin C and soluble fiber collard greens also contain cancer fighting and heart healthy nutrients such as sulforaphane and diindolylmethane 4 Goat s Milk In many parts of the world goat s milk is not only preferred over cow s milk but it s also more readily available The fat and protein in goat s milk is closer to the composition of human milk making it a little easier for us to digest Goat s milk contains only trace amounts of an allergenic casein protein alpha S1 found in cow s milk Goat s milk also has 13 percent more calcium 25 percent more Vitamin B6 nearly twice as much Vitamin A and double the potassium of cow s milk However it does lack Vitamin B12 and folic acid Some health and whole foods stores sell pasteurized goat s milk with folic acid added 5 Kimchi This fermented cabbage dish made with a mix of garlic vinegar chili peppers and other spices is the most common side dish in Korea It can be eaten alone or mixed with rice or noodles is used in soup and stews and may even turn up as a topping on pizza and hamburgers It s low in fat and high in fiber and one serving can contain up to three quarters the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C and carotene It s also rich in Vitamins A and B and healthy bacteria called lactobacilli which aid digestion and can help stop and even prevent yeast infections Health magazine named kimchi in its list of top five World s Healthiest Foods for being loaded with vitamins aiding digestion and even possibly reducing cancer growth You can most likely pick up a jar at any Asian market 6 Miso Miso is a traditional Japanese condiment that is becoming easier to find in the West in Japan it is most commonly consumed in miso soup a traditional Japanese breakfast dish This soybean paste is created by inoculating trays of rice with a fungus starter then mixing in ground soybeans and sea salt and letting it ferment before grinding it into a paste It s an excellent source of B12 essential fatty acids and trace minerals such as zinc magnesium and copper It s quite high in sodium but a little goes a long way a tablespoon of miso has just 25 calories and gives you 2 grams of protein 7 Quinoa Quinoa is not a common grain in the U S even though it was domesticated in South America thousands of years ago It is one of the healthiest grains a half cup of cooked quinoa has 5 grams of protein which is more than any other grain plus iron riboflavin and magnesium It s gluten free and easy to digest high in fiber and is an excellent substitute for starchy side dishes such as white rice 8 Sea Vegetables Seaweed is another traditional Asian food and possesses one of the broadest ranges of vitamins and minerals of any food in the world Rich in protein iron iodine and zinc most edible sea plants also generally contain high doses of beta carotene Vitamins B1 B2 B6 C and K and folic acid Seaweed has anti inflammatory properties and also contains a healthy dose of antioxidants Although often referred to collectively as seaweed there are actually thousands of varieties generally classified by color as brown red or green sea vegetables They can be added to salads and soups used in sushi preparation and cooked with rice or beans to create healthy side dishes

night Three 50 of which was fed to my ever so voracious garbage disposal It was traumatic I had been dreaming of lemon cake for weeks Weeks Lemon layers lemon curd and some fluffy cloud frosting That s all Not that huge of a request right Wrong I had a promising recipe for a two layer cake but I had been dreaming of three You can just spread out the batter into three pans right They ll just be uber thin Wrong They ll be crunchy and ew When you ve got sketchy cake layers take my advice and stop right there Don t try and stack them with too thin but really good lemon curd and don t make last minute cream cheese frosting instead of meringue Just don t do it It s really a poor choice all around It tastes good yes but it s a soupy flop hot mess mush cake lemon thing No one really wants one of those If you re anything like me it ll be close to midnight when you assemble your disaster You might eat a decent amount of it out of shame and then sit on the kitchen floor and cry Through your tears you will then decide that it s a great time to start making a redeem yourself lemon poppy seed bundt cake When you realize you re one and a half egg yolks short and don t have authentic buttermilk stop Don t make it anyways Go to sleep and make it in the morning Don t use extra egg whites and butter instead of the missing yolks Don t take it out of the oven before it s done and above all do NOT let your impatience get the best of you and take it out of the pan while it s still hot It will come half out of the pan and taste feel like spongy supermaket angel sponge food cake And by then it will be two in the morning your feet will hurt and your tearstained cheeks will be covered in abstract drippy eyeliner art Apparently the whole third time s a charm deal is pretty valid When you ve passed the two failed cakes mark it s about time to make some cupcakes Cupcakes are invincible These are a bit on the laborious side of things but they re worth every mix and scoop and fill and toast They re filled with my favorite ever lemon curd and topped with the meringue of your dreams These are time to make amends cupcakes They re sorry I forgot to pack your lunch cupcakes They re look at my fancy cupcake cupcakes Adapted from Martha Stewart and Une Deux Senses Note in a perfect world I d make the lemon curd the night or even several days before Bake fill and frost the next morning For the cake 2 1 2 cups all purpose flour 1 2 teaspoon baking powder 1 2 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon lemon zest 1 cup 2 sticks unsalted butter room temperature 1 1 2 cups sugar 2 large eggs plus 3 large egg yolks 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1 cup low fat buttermilk Preheat oven to 350 degrees Line two cupcake pans with liners In a medium bowl whisk flour baking powder baking soda salt and lemon zest In a large bowl using an electric mixer beat butter and 1 1 2 cups sugar until light and fluffy With mixer on low beat in eggs and yolks one at a time Beat in lemon juice Alternately beat in flour mixture and buttermilk beginning and ending with flour mixture mix just until combined Divide batter evenly among pans filling each 3 4 full Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean 22 25 minutes Let cool in pans 10 minutes and then cool cupcakes completely on a wire rack For the lemon curd 1 2 cup 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 8 tablespoons butter cubed 1 1 2 cup superfine sugar 4 eggs 4 egg yolks 2 tablespoons grated lemon zest In a heatproof bowl whisk together all ingredients except butter Place it over a small pot of simmering water whisking constantly When the mixture thickens to coat the back of a spoon so that when you run your finger through it the finger stripe doesn t disappear take if off of the pot Add the butter and whisk until it melts Allow to cool slightly then transfer to a clean glass jar cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate For the meringue 2 large egg white 1 2 cup of sugar 1 4 tsp cream of tartar 1 2 tsp vanilla extract For the meringue put the sugar cream of tartar and egg whites into the bowl of an electric mixer Set the bowl over a pot of simmering water the bowl should not be touching the water and allow the sugar to melt into the eggs Cook until the mixture has reached 160 degrees Fahrenheit then remove the bowl from the pot of water stir in the vanilla and beat the mixture until stiff peaks form about 3 5 minutes set aside To assemble Turn your oven on broil at 400 degrees Cut a cone out of your cupcake with a small sharp knife Fill the opening with a spoonful of lemon curd Either cut the very top off of the cone and cover the opening or just leave it open either will work Once your cupcakes are filled cover them with a generous heap of meringue Use the back of a spoon to create stiff peaks in your meringue and place the cupcakes on a baking sheet Place them in the oven and watch very carefully until the tops are just golden brown 2 4 minutes depending on the strength of your broiler Don t look away for a second If you have a torch congrats on your courage and feel free to use that instead of the oven method It s probably much much easier Let the meringue tops cool before serving Cakes fail every now and then That s just life Jordana Like this Be the first to like this post once upon a time, i made three cakes in one night. three. 50%

favorite Ask a professional chef to taste and evaluate a dish and odds are that if they think it needs something that something will be salt acid fat or crunch Why Because these are fundamental elements that make food pop They aren t going to turn undercooked eggplant into a silk purse but if you give these actors a solid basic dish to work with they can transform it into a knockout I never develop a new recipe without at least considering how I have them in play You could make it your culinary New Year s resolution to do the same Today we ll take a look at salt and over the next few weeks I ll complete the series with acid fat and crunch Note acid is up now Salt is the most basic taste enhancer and the one home cooks are most afraid of I think there are two fears First in most cases oversalted food can t be easily fixed So rather than take a chance it becomes easy to think well if they want more they can just add it at the table The problem is food needs salt during the cooking process The salt helps extract moisture and concentrate flavor and it needs to be in the interior of the food when you bite into it Second people are concerned over the link between sodium and hypertension If you are worried about this I can do you no greater service than to refer you to the chapter on salt in Jeffrey Steingarten s The Man Who Ate Everything which you should read anyhow because the whole book is informative and hilarious Obviously if your health professional has told you to minimize salt listen to them but if you are just doing it out of general free floating anxiety read Steingarten s well researched piece and see what you think If you want to fully appreciate the importance of salt in making food appetizing try a head to head comparison Scramble two eggs with absolutely no salt and two more with a couple of good pinches Or spread a piece of good bread with unsalted butter and then eat a bite with or without a bit of salt sprinkled on top In both cases without the salt you have a sort of bland neutral sweetness The salt balances the sweetness and allows you to taste much more complexity and subtlety Good cooks salt food as they go and taste frequently When sauteing I do this as each group of ingredients is added to the pan If you look through my recipes on this site you ll see that almost every step includes an instruction like taste and adjust seasoning or salt to taste One of my great fears when writing recipes is that those instructions will be ignored and salt will be only an afterthought Palates differ ingredients differ salts differ and often what is needed is just a pinch or two too little to be worth measuring Keep an open container of Kosher salt next to your stove and add a bit at a time until you suddenly hear the flavors sing With practice you ll hear that chorus easily You ll notice I said Kosher salt I use it almost exclusively for general cooking as opposed to finishing dishes because the larger grain size makes it easier to pick up and distribute For baking you have to hope the recipe author tells you whether Kosher or fine grained table salt is intended as they have different weights for the same volume Finishing dishes with salt can be the real coup de grace Something about having a few grains of salt as the first thing that meets your palate is innately appetizing to most people Think of a well seasoned french fry Salt hits your tongue almost too much for a second and then the crisp shell gives way to the fluffy mild potato Fried foods are obvious but almost anything from caramels to polenta will appreciate a miniscule final sprinkle Italians have a concept of capriccioso applied to chili flakes Rather than mixing them in completely they may add them at the last minute to get surprising little pinpricks of heat Salt is the same way it can be more exciting to taste the individual crystal There are many wonderful finishing salts from all over the world Any taste differences are quite minor What counts is appearance and texture I have quite a few of these salts but I d never be sad if I could only keep Maldon It is superbly flaky adding an element of crunch as well as salinity If you have never bought a finishing salt before you might choke on the idea of spending 7 for 8 ounces of salt Remember you are using it in tiny quantities A single box lasts me months at home and adds pleasure to so many dishes Give a box as a gift and to a friend and they will first look at you like you are nuts and then the next time you see them they will thank you profusely So are you ready to really season your food , vegetarian, veggie, veg, recipe, recipes, cooking, eating, dining, blog, restaurants, organic, cookbooks flaky maldon sea salt, my personal favorite ask a professional chef to taste and evaluate a dish, and odds are that if they think it needs something, that something will be salt, acid, fat, or crunch."",""url"":""herbivoracious 2010 01 crunch acid

color and shade of baked fruit desserts the goofier the name be it grunt slump buckle or betty the better a reader named Shirley asked me if I d ever tried anything called Blueberry Boy Bait And people seeing as I unabashedly choose magazines for their covers and fawn over the titles of books I Was Told There d Be Cake anyone that I have no interest in reading let s just say that although I had no idea what Blueberry Boy Bait was I knew it would be made in my kitchen sooner than soon Well actually I d bookmarked it for August when I believed blueberries to be in season only to find them at my local greenmarket four days later where I proceeded to plotz from happiness Bring on the boy baiting I mean seriously Boy Bait could have been blueberry gravy for meatloaf garlic pickled blueberries for a potato salad or any other unforutnate sounding blueberry concoctions though I now suspect it s just a matter of time before someone emails me a blueberry gravy or pickled blueberry recipe go on bring it on I guess I asked for it and I probably would have still made it because boy plus bait If nothing else the story would have had a great title Fortunately for all of us but I d say mostly Alex me and the friends I fob my baked goods off on Blueberry Boy Bait is delicious a buttery rich single layer cake studded with fresh blueberries and swaddled in a sheet of cinnamon sugar In fact if you ve been hanging around here for a couple months you might even note its resemblance to a certain Raspberry Buttermilk Cake so let me be quick to point out what makes it noticeably different It s the butter There s a lot more of it I d dare say there s so much more that cake is almost more buttery than it needs to be but I know that would be just impossible Implausible Or at least that s what the boy in my house said before he reached for a second piece Thus I guess it worked One year ago I finished a wedding cake Two years ago Rosanne Cash s Potato Salad Blueberry Boy BaitAdapted from Cook s Country which adapted it from the original Like any recipe with a great name this also has a great story which was that in 1954 a 15 year old girl stole the show but only won second prize in the junior division of an early Pillbury Bake Off with a variation of this recipe named she said after the effect it had on boys Cook s Country magazine dusted this recipe off from the Pillsbury Bake Off Dessert Cookbook and made a few tweaks to bring it more deliciously into the modern age butter was swapped for shortening the quantity of blueberries was doubled and some plain sugar was replaced with brown sugar The result Let s just say you don t need to be a boy to be lured in Serves 12 generously 2 cups plus 1 teaspoon all purpose flour1 tablespoon baking powder1 teaspoon table salt16 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 sticks softened3 4 cup packed light brown sugar1 2 cup granulated sugar3 large eggs1 cup whole milk though buttermilk which was all I had on hand worked just great 1 2 cup blueberries fresh or frozen if frozen do not defrost first as it tends to muddle in the batter Topping1 2 cup blueberries fresh or frozen do not defrost 1 4 cup granulated sugar1 2 teaspoon ground cinnamon For the cake Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees Grease and flour 13 by 9 inch baking pan Whisk two cups flour baking powder and salt

Toss blueberries with remaining one teaspoon flour Using rubber spatula gently fold in blueberries Spread batter into prepared pan For the topping Scatter blueberries over top of batter Stir sugar and

muscle increase energy levels reduce stress or just generally look and feel healthier you ve come to the right place Subscribe to my free weekly newsletter for tips advice and special insider only information Learn more about the Primal Lifestyle by visiting the Primal Blueprint 101 page Thanks for visiting It s been several decades since Bobby McFerrin Yes Bobby McFerrin not Bob Marley wrote the hit song Don t Worry be Happy and yet we still can t well quit worrying and get happy Whether it s the kids work or a to do list that simply won t quit the reality is there are hundreds of sources of stress in our lives and very few real ways short of hiring a personal assistant and even that s no guarantee to deal with them or are there The following are a list of our favorite de stressing tips so kick back relax and feel the stress melt away 1 Get Things Done Pick up milk purchase stamps update your checkbook turn in the forms for the kids summer camp and the list goes on so much so that sometimes even the thought of having to tackle your mental to do list is more intimidating than actually just getting it done Unfortunately in these instances you have no choice but to take care of things To make it more manageable and remove the stress from the situation transfer your mental list into a more tangible medium either in the form of a written list or an electronic Outlook or Blackberry reminder list Not only will writing everything down free up much needed mental space it ll also give you a visual place to check off tasks as you complete them 2 Learn to Say No With so many ways to say no it s a wonder we ever say yes Feeling overloaded Then the last thing you need to do is agree to bake a batch of brownies for the soccer fund raiser Yet for many of us and women in particular saying no is simply not an option However it should be noted that saying that you just don t have the capacity to take on an extra chore can be a huge stress reliever and free up time for the really important things like an impromptu kick around with your little soccer star When declining an offer be firm If necessary let the person making the request know that you can t fit it into a schedule and if guilt overcomes you offer to do something else or take on the task once your week is a little less hectic 3 Work it Out It has long been reported that exercise can reduce stress with one 2003 study suggesting that short intense bursts of exercise are most effective at reducing stress and stress related diseases such as cardiovascular disease While this is definitely good news for those of us who are feeling a time crunch it should be noted that other forms of exercise such as hiking pilates and yoga can also help quieten the mind and help you unwind 4 Peace and Quiet If you re the type of person who whips themselves into a frenzy planning a relaxing weekend away perhaps it s time to refocus your de stressing activities to include something a little more manageable Next time the going gets rough retreat to a quiet room or shut the door to the office close your eyes breathe deeply and think positive thoughts Think you still need to split from your everyday environment Consider a trip to a spa for a soothing massage or taking a morning to embark on a hike spend some time on the beach or otherwise relax whatever it takes to melt the stress away 5 Natural Sunlight Everyone feels a little happier when the sun is shining and the reasons aren t just psychological According to several studies the less natural light there is in a room the more stressed not to mention sleepy a person will feel In fact a study PDF by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that workers were more productive and reported higher rates of job satisfaction when exposed to natural light Stuck in cubicle dom Make an appointment each day yes that s right put it on that Outlook calendar to get outside take a stroll and absorb a couple of rays Trust us you ll feel better for it 6 Supplementation While the answer to your stress can rarely be found at the bottom of a bottle both of the alcoholic and prescription variety sometimes supplementation can prove beneficial For example a supplement that contains golden root or rhodiola rosea has stress reducing effects that can improve your mental outlook as well as give you the energy boost you need to tackle the issue at hand 7 Phone a Friend Popularized in the game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire for contestants in a bind phoning a friend can actually reduce stress In a 2004 study conducted by researchers at Tokyo University it was determined that social buffering may accelerate recovery from stress and change your experience of it as well as speed recovery Now granted the experiment was conducted with rats but a second study conducted by researchers at UCLA showed that following the death of the spouse women with a strong social network were more likely to survive the experience without any new physical impairments or permanent loss of vitality Our verdict Perhaps it s time to buddy up 8 Music Man Chalk another one up for the benefits of music turns out it can help alleviate stress too In a 2001 study conducted by researchers at Adelaide University in Australia it was determined that organ music significantly reduced a range of negative emotions commonly experienced during Christmas such as tension depression anger and fatigue Our inclination If it works during the super stressful holiday season it ll work year round Now go rock out 9 Just Do it Although sex is probably the last thing on your mind when you re feeling stressed sometimes getting down is the best way to get over it In fact according to a study by Canadian researchers when bacteria get in to hot water literally but it s a stressor for them it activates a sex inducer gene that ups the likelihood of reproduction Need further proof A 2006 study suggests that sex can reduce the stress and anxiety experienced prior to public speaking and that greater frequency of intercourse is associated with greater benefits 10 Glass Half Full Well perhaps not this optimistic We ve all heard the term making a mountain out of a molehill but when you re in the midst of an existential crisis sometimes it is difficult to take a step back and keep your cool However in the face of a stressor or other adversity it is important to ask yourself a few questions Will this matter next week How about next month If I knew I was going to die in a week would this be something I would want to spend this minute of my remaining time on Is what I am basing my feelings on a fact or is it an assumption Sometimes just asking yourself these questions can help you gain perspective on the issue so much so that before you know it you ve

visual guide to cooking with onions and garlic at epicurious.com"",""body"":""B ulb vegetables which include onions garlic and ramps all related and members of the lily family are usually just culinary accents Add in small amounts and they ll make a dish come alive with aromatic undertones When used raw they add a punch to salads and salsas But the real magic takes place when they re cooked A light saut\u00e9 or slow roast mellows their pungent acrid flavors and coaxes out their natural sweetness There are many different ways to categorize bulb vegetables so named because we consume the bulb Spring bulbs such as scallions and ramps need refrigeration Look for greens that are neither limp nor brown and white bulbs that are firm Storage bulbs are more typically onionlike round thin skinned vegetables that can simply be kept out in a dark dry place Chives are technically related to onions and garlic but are generally considered to be an herb For seeds visit your local plant nursery or visit online stores such as John Scheepers Kitchen Garden Seeds For buying and preparation advice for these bulb vegetables check out our tips Spanish onion Characteristics This storage onion is relatively mild but not as much as sweet onions Round with a thin brownish papery skin Spanish onions are the most common type of onion in the United States Pictured is a yellow Spanish onion but they are also available as red and white If a recipe simply calls for an onion a Spanish onion is the one to use For recipes using Spanish onions click here Shallots Alternate Names Gray Shallot Red ShallotCharacteristics The shallot often looks more like garlic than an onion because of its small bulbous cluster and thin dry coppery brown skin Individual shallot cloves resemble oversized garlic cloves with their pointed tapered ends except that the shallot possesses a luminescent purple hue Its flavor is milder than an onion s but its bite is still sharp when uncooked While the French incorporate the shallot into many dishes it s also popular throughout southeast Asian cuisine as in Goreng Bawang an Indonesian recipe for fried shallots For recipes using shallots click here White onion Characteristics This storage onion is named for the color of its thin skin and flesh With a taste that s more tangy than sweet or sour this is the onion of choice when making Latin and Central American dishes especially Mexican food For recipes using white onions click here Garlic Characteristics A truly international vegetable garlic is sold many ways whole bulb already peeled cloves pre sliced and minced At the farmers market newly harvested garlic is sometimes sold with the curled green stems still attached to the bulb the ends of which are called scapes Scapes can be prepared and consumed in a myriad of ways finely chopped saut\u00e9ed and served like chives and scallions An unpeeled garlic clove doesn t have a very strong scent but once the clove s body has been damaged a pungent odor is released To get garlic that s sweet and fragrant either saut\u00e9 or roast it But be careful not to burn the garlic which will result in an acrid smell For recipes using garlic click here Pearl onions Characteristics These very small onions are valued for their sweet delicate flavor and are usually served as an accompaniment Pearl onions can be creamed roasted or glazed Italians use balsamic vinegar Middle Easterners apply tamarind Pickled pearl onions make a great garnish to the classic martini And since peeling such small onions can be a chore look for frozen pre peeled ones at your market For recipes using pearl onions click here Red onion Alternate name Purple onionCharacteristics The bright reddish purple skin makes this onion hard to miss it s a favorite ingredient in salads To many palates red onions have the sharpest flavor in the family so use uncooked red onions sparingly To soften the taste chill raw onions in ice water for 20 minutes before serving For recipes using red onions click here Sweet onions Alternate names Fresh onion spring onion summer onionPictured top to bottom Bermuda VidaliaCharacteristics These storage onions are sweet because they have a lower concentration of sulfur allowing the sugar content to stand out People who like onions but dislike the strong taste will find sweet onions a good alternative Some people even consume them raw like ripe fruit Besides Vidalia and Bermuda whose name refers to a time when most onions imported to the U S were grown in Bermuda other well known sweet varieties grown primarily in parts of the South Southwest and Northwest United States include Walla Walla Maui Sweet Imperial and Texas Spring Sweet These don t keep as well as other storage onions so try to use them up as soon as possible For recipes using sweet onions click here Ramps Alternate names Tennessee truffles wild leek ramson wild leek ail des boisCharacteristics This North American native spring onion is edible in its entirety from the tops of its lily of the valley like leaves and stems all the way down to the bulb Eaten raw a ramp tastes strong and more like garlic than scallion but if cooked its flavor turns mildly sweet When serving try to keep the entire plant intact for a lovely presentation For recipes using ramps click here Scallions Alternate names Green onion bunching onion Chinese onion Welsh onionCharacteristics This spring onion s flavorful bite makes it a popular ingredient in Asian cooking as exemplified in the classic Korean Seafood Pancake Some recipes may specify using only the long green hollow leaves or the white bulbous ends but the scallion is entirely edible Recipes usually require that scallions be chopped Scallions are interchangeable with ramps Don t let them languish in the fridge use soon after purchase For recipes using scallions click here Cipollini Alternate names Cipollini onion Italian pearl onionCharacteristics This Italian onion doesn t look like cousins thanks to its flat top and squat shape but it is growing in popularity and availability in the U S Its taste is less acrid than that of its relatives making it ideal for creamed or glazed onions And because of the cipollinis size and shape they re easy to cook and serve whole Try them roasted or grilled on skewers For recipes using cipolline click here read a visual guide to cooking

cupcakes."",""body"":""Big picture That s what these are big picture cupcakes As in make these for someone you really really REALLY like big picture cupcakes Or like try to think about the big picture when you stop to pump gas into your car decide to do a good deed for yourself and throw away some random gum wrappers water bottles receipts and um the remnants of about 16 granola bars while you re fueling up and then proceed to THROW YOUR CAR KEY into the trash can along with everything else The trash can at the gas station Only one of the dirtiest places on Earth But don t worry try to think big picture This is just a blip on the radar At least that s what my husband told me yesterday when I said that I absolutely NEEDED this purse that was on sale but I feel like I shouldn t buy it and did he think I should buy it and he goes uh you already have that purse in a different color and I mentally curse myselft for marrying someone metrosexual Well as metrosexual as you can get with cutting all the sleeves off your NASCAR t shirts but still I responded that duh I WAAAAAS thinking big picture like dreaming about how cute this purse would look in July and August which is sooo far away and even how next year it will still be in style and didn t he know that this is majorly big picture thinking I guess that s not what he had in mind Hmmpf Too bad we made the best move ever post marriage which included never combining our bank accounts and remaining independent Worst move ever not living together before Can you say drop down drag out fights These cupcakes ARE big picture cupcakes though They are one of those cupcakes that you remember One that you crave One that becomes a staple especially when you can make 24 of them and keep them in your freezer and then eat one with extra peanut butter chocolate ganache for dinner But really my dinner last night was sourdough pretzels dipped in crazy feta with a side of peanut butter chocolate ganache But who cares It s no secret that I loath all things coffee uh hello dirty water EXCEPT for coffee ice cream It became my mission in life to make all coffee like drinks taste identical to coffee ice cream which has been fabulous and horrible all rolled into one because then I can t stop consuming them and I feel like I m on speed And I talk a lot I like to think that I inherited my coffee ice cream fascination from my grandparents who always had a half gallon in their freezer Unlike me though they were able to consume it in normal sized portions like a little cup here and a little taste there Not like a large spoon before breakfast and a soup bowl s worth for dessert Then Cold Stone appeared and they flaunted this creation called mud pie mojo in my face complete with coffee ice cream fudge Oreos and peanut butter mashed into one I mean they practically forced it down my throat For die hard coffee fans the combination may sound heinous but it truly just WORKS And that s how we ended up here Obviously these cupcakes take a bit more work than boring regular mini cakes you need the time and patience for a few easy steps as well as the space in your freezer to store these little chunks o love but I promise they are 100 worth it They take away all your worries of the big picture Because what else do you need besides cupcakes Peanut Butter Fudge Coffee Ice Cream Cupcakes cake recipe from these pb

"http://www.vegetarian-nutrition.info/updates/onions.php"	"386"	"{""title"":""Health Benefits of Onions "",""body"":""Onions are Beneficial for Your Health Onions are beneficial to health What would life be like without onions The onion has been used as an ingredient in various dishes for thousands of years by many cultures around the world World onion production is steadily increasing so that onion is now the second most important horticultural crop after tomatoes There are many different varieties of onion red yellow white and green each with their own unique flavor from very strong to mildly sweet Onions can be eaten raw cooked fried dried or roasted They are commonly used to flavor dips salads soups spreads stir fry and other dishes Onions Allium cepa belong to the lily family the same family as garlic leeks chives scallions and shallots There are over 600 species of Allium distributed all over Europe North America Northern Africa and Asia The plants can be used as ornamentals vegetables spices or as medicine There are over 120 different documented uses of the Alliums Onion and other Allium vegetables are characterized by their rich content of thiosulfinates sulfides sulfoxides and other odoriferous sulfur compounds The cysteine sulfoxides are primarily responsible for the onion flavor and produce the eye irritating compounds that induce lacrimation The thiosulfinates exhibit antimicrobial properties Onion is effective against many bacteria including Bacillus subtilis Salmonella and E coli Onion is not as potent as garlic since the sulfur compounds in onion are only about one quarter the level found in garlic The Value of Onions Onions have a variety of medicinal effects Early American settlers used wild onions to treat colds coughs and asthma and to repel insects In Chinese medicine onions have been used to treat angina coughs bacterial infections and breathing problems The World Health Organization WHO supports the use of onions for the treatment of poor appetite and to prevent atherosclerosis In addition onion extracts are recognized by WHO for providing relief in the treatment of coughs and colds asthma and bronchitis Onions are known to decrease bronchial spasms An onion extract was found to decrease allergy induced bronchial constriction in asthma patients Onions are a very rich source of fructo oligosaccharides These oligomers stimulate the growth of healthy bifidobacteria and suppress the growth of potentially harmful bacteria in the colon In addition they can reduce the risk of tumors developing in the colon Cardiovascular Help Onions contain a number of sulfides similar to those found in garlic which may lower blood lipids and blood pressure In India communities that never consumed onions or garlic had blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels substantially higher and blood clotting times shorter than the communities that ate liberal amounts of garlic and onions Onions are a rich source of flavonoids substances known to provide protection against cardiovascular disease Onions are also natural anticlotting agents since they possess substances with fibrinolytic activity and can suppress platelet clumping The anticlotting effect of onions closely correlates with their sulfur content Cancer Prevention Onion extracts rich in a variety of sulfides provide some protection against tumor growth In central Georgia where Vidalia onions are grown mortality rates from stomach cancer are about one half the average level for the United States Studies in Greece have shown a high consumption of onions garlic and other allium herbs to be protective against stomach cancer Chinese with the highest intake of onions garlic and other Allium vegetables have a risk of stomach cancer 40 percent less than those with the lowest intake Elderly Dutch men and women with the highest onion consumption at least one half onion day had one half the level of stomach cancer compared with those consuming no onions at all Western Yellow New York Bold and Northern Red onions have the richest concentration of flavonoids and phenolics providing them with the greatest antioxidant and anti proliferative activity of 10 onions tested The mild tasting Western White and Vidalia onions had the lowest antioxidant content and lowest anti proliferative activity The consumer trend to increasingly purchase the less pungent milder onion varieties may not be the best since the onions with a stronger flavor and higher astringency appear to have superior health promoting properties Use and Safety Onions have a universal appeal They are safely consumed by most people However consuming large quantities of onions can lead to stomach distress and gastrointestinal irritation that may result in nausea and diarrhea There are no known interactions with drugs except that they can potentiate the action of anticoagulants Conclusion Onions and other Allium species are highly valued herbs possessing culinary and medicinal value Some of their beneficial properties are seen after long term usage Onion may be a useful herb for the prevention of cardiovascular disease especially since they diminish the risk of blood clots Onion also protects against stomach and other cancers as well as protecting against certain infections Onion can improve lung function especially in asthmatics The more pungent varieties of onion appear to possess the greatest concentration of health promoting phytochemicals Author Winston Craig MPH PhD RD Printer Friendly Page Search Our Site For More

long way within the past two centuries but sometimes accidents illnesses and deformities can confound even the most educated and experienced doctor The following list contains ten of the most famous medical miracles performed by doctors and perhaps by the patient s own will to survive These miracles consisted of a willingness on the part of doctors patients and parents to consent to medical treatment in an otherwise unbearable or fatal situation In most cases the miracles seem most obvious on the front end when patients survive or have overcome odds against living a normal life In all cases however the patients plights and the medical remedies have altered those patients lives forever Only time will tell if these patients continue to live a healthy if not totally normal life Survives Orthopedic Decapitation Doctors gave nine year old Jordan Taylor a one percent chance of survival after his skull was lifted from his vertebrae in an automobile accident Dr Richard Roberts connected Jordan s head with metal plates screws and rods and three months later Jordan returned to school He can walk and talk This is a medical miracle considering the extent of his injuries Survived Without Heart for 118 Days Fourteen year old D Zhana Simmons needed a new heart but the wait was longer than her current heart could bear Doctors including Dr Si Pham removed her heart and kept her alive for four months with two heart transplants that involved heart pumps During that time D Zhana said she felt like a fake person but is grateful for her new heart and for the ability to keep her alive during the waiting process Stabbed in Head and Survived Michael Hill now holds the Guinness World Book of Records title for Largest Object Removed From Human Skull but he probably wishes he never had to go that route Hill answered a friend s door in Jacksonville Florida and was stabbed in the head with a 20 cm 8 in survival knife on April 25 1998 Hill walked to another friend s house and they took him to Shands jacksonville Trauma Center Four hours after he arrived the knife was removed While he survived the wound caused permanent damage to his memory and paralyzed his left hand Man Cut in Half Survives and Now Walks Peng Shulin s body was cut in half by a lorry in 1995 Although it was a miracle that he survived he was chained to a bed for years as he developed skills to build up his arm muscles Recently doctors at the China Rehabilitation Research Centre in Beijing learned about Peng s plight and devised a way for him to walk on his own again The device is an egg like casing with two bionic legs attached Girl Survives Removal of Two Legs Two Arms Lakshmi Tatma was born attached to a headless identical twin sister a rare case that left Lakshmi unable to crawl or walk But she had one complete body with a near perfect set of organs so Dr Sharan Patil led a surgery team into one of the most complicated surgeries ever conducted to remove two year old Lakshmi s extra limbs and organs The surgery was successful which allows Lakshmi now to live a normal and hopefully long life Leaky Brain Fixed with Glue Ella Grace Honeyman was born with Vein of Galen malformation which causes tiny holes in brain blood vessels The seventeen month old girl was given just weeks to live when her parents hired a team of pioneering U S surgeons Those surgeons fired organic glue into the artery holes to plug them While the doctors saved her life the operations may be ongoing in a process to fix any new leaks This disease affects about 250 people in the world A Tooth for an Eye Martin Jones lose his left eye and was blinded in the right eye when a tub of molten aluminum exploded in his face twelve years ago Then he allowed surgeon Christopher Lui and his team to pull a canine from his mouth attach a tiny optical lens to that tooth and then implant the tooth into his eye socket The process took about four months but Martin can see again through that one eye And he seems to relish the shock that his eye gives to onlookers it s a bit spooky but serviceable Man Awakens After 20 Year Sleep In 1983 Terry Wallis suffered a severe brain injury in a car accident Twenty years later he emerged from what doctors call a minimally conscious state which is somewhere between being awake and being in a vegetative state Doctors now believe that Terry s brain built new pathways during those two decades that allowed him to become fully conscious and began to talk However he lost the ability to store new memories and he maintains physical disabilities from the original accident Electrodes Stimulate Dead Brain A patient was unable to communicate swallow or make coordinated physical movements for almost six years after he was seriously assaulted now can

if it is appropriate to the case may receive immediate results Cured by a Spider Bite David Blancarte almost was killed in a motorcycle accident about two decades ago he survived but has been confined to a wheelchair Then he was bitten by a Brown Recluse spider a bite that sent him to a hospital for eight months But during that time he began to feel his legs and within five days David was walking

State If you love decade inspired wardrobes then you ll love blogger Rhiannon Leifheit s blog Liebemarlene Vintage With doe eyes and doll like features this blogger manages to pull off any outfit with ease and a cute pair of vintage booties on her feet Interested Read on for tips on how to get her vintage style wardrobe 1 Dress it UpRhiannon has the ultimate collection of vintage dresses Whether they re long sleeved short sleeved or sleeveless they re always cute full of whimsy and paired with the perfect pair of shoes In fact Rhiannon has admitted that she actually doesn t like wearing pants of any kind Not Even Jeans I can hear a thousand college girls collectively gasping as I type this Put your raised eyebrows down girls I can hear your arguments now It s so much easier to just slip on a pair of jeans and They re comfortable I have news for you ladies dresses are way easier to slip on and they re ten times more comfortable so save it for the judge How can one go through life without a pair of jeans on her stems Simple Rhiannon picks and chooses statement dresses instead How many times have you found yourself stumbling into your trusty jeans and then rummaging through your closet for a good 20 minutes pillaging for a decent top to complete your outfit only to find that you re going to be late to Chem Lab Every day right I know I ve been there There s an easy way to fix that wear a dress It s an entire outfit in one piece Boom 20 minutes early to class AND you can chat up the cute guy who sits in front of you I ll level with you you don t have to forgo your jeans forever I m just trying to give you options and save you 20 minutes of pulling your hair out The bottom line is dresses are an easy way to save time when you re in a rush Pop one on and viol\u00e0 outfit complete and you re out the door 2 Baby It s Cold OutsideSummer is over and it s way too cold to wear dresses right Oh you don t know how wrong you are my friend you don t have to abandon your dresses just because the sky is cloudy Dresses are the ultimate layering staple and are a snap to transition into fall with Do you have cold feet Just do what Rhiannon does slip on a pair of tights and your legs will be warm and toasty And if you re feeling really daring you can forgo basic black tights for reds blues grays even polka dotted or lace yes you too can be Blair Waldorf Tights aside the rest of your outfit is a snap just follow the Rhiannon Formula of Dressing and you ll easily look just as cute as her What s the formula Take this down class I expect you to know this for midterms Cute Dress Tights Boots Cozy Cardigan Warm Overcoat Style Success Easy as pie 3 Skirting the IssueWhile Rhiannon loves her dresses she definitely isn t one to shy away from skirts And I can see why they dress up your outfit instantly and revive you from skinny jean drudgery How can you mimic Rhiannon s skirt style Look for skirts with interesting colors or patterns like florals checkers or pleats yes the black secretary skirt with the tucked in blouse is nice but it s just been done too many times now you should make a statement not blend in Instead try tucking a simple blouse into your red checkered skirt and throwing on the ever versatile cardigan you ll look sophisticated and be comfortable One thing I do recommend when wearing a skirt is to keep things balanced Think of it like this your body is turned upside down Instead of your top being the focal point of your outfit your bottom should be especially if you have a floral or some other type of print One last tip I have to recommend with skirts is to belt it Skinny or thick belts add interest to your outfit and sometimes are the finishing touch you need to pull it together Still want more tips on sporting a skirt Check out Kristina and Meggy s blurbs on skirts and how to wear them Blogger Inspired Wardrobe Coat Shop Ruche Necklace Modcloth Dress Modcloth Booties Heels com Cardigan John LewisWhile Rhiannon s clothes are mostly pulled from vintage or thrift stores I know that most of us college girls don t have the time to go scouring for clothes Because of this I pulled things from all over the interweb instead I do recommend trying out thrifting though It s the best way to save money and look cute plus you ll have one of a kind pieces For today s blogger inspired wardrobe I pulled together a bevy of neutral tones and paired them with cools and brights To start off I wrangled up a cute empire waisted dress from Modcloth Then I chose a mustard yellow cardigan for you to throw on oh so casually when it gets nippy Still cold If that s the case to battle those blustering winds of December I chose a chic ruffled overcoat to layer right on top And to give you an ounce of refinement I picked a little golden bow necklace and some brown chunky heeled booties to add some interest to your outfit and keeps things cute and whimsical I like to think that Rhiannon would approve Thoughts I remember discovering Rhiannon s blog way back in my Junior year of high school Boy time flies After a couple visits to her blog she quickly became one of my daily reads While I know that her style isn t for everyone I can t help but admire her for her one of a kind point of view She pulls things from her closet so effortlessly yet always looks so put together I can t help but admire her for it So what do you guys think Did I convince you to leave the skinny jeans in the closet once in a while or are you gonna keep on keeping on Do you like Rhiannon s style or is it too old school for you Either way let me know in

Sunday Brunches of Scottsdale and Phoenix Arizona "",""body"":""Posted by David Porter on Saturday November 26 2011 7 Comments Apparently no one is absolutely certain where the term brunch came into being The word is a portmanteau which linguistics describe as a blend of two or more words breakfast lunch into a new word Some have suggested that the term was coined in Britain in 1895 to describe a Sunday meal for Saturday night carousers While others suggest it was an early 20th century New York reporter allegedly speaking of the typical mid day eating habits of a newspaper reporter In my Midwestern upbringing brunch was done on Sundays It usually occurred with family and or friends after church and involved a massive spread of mouth watering entr\u00e9es As Scottsdale and Phoenix are both significant tourist destinations we thought it would be fun to compile the top 10 Sunday brunches in Scottsdale and Phoenix For days Carol scoured Google to find newspaper articles blogs magazine articles and even a little word of mouth to compile our list We then set ourselves upon the arduous task somebody s gotta do it of personally experiencing each and every one of our choices Nearly 100 mouthwatering photographs of Scottsdale and Phoenix Sunday brunches First off we decided that this wasn t going to be a this one s better than that one type of deal but rather a comprehensive sharing of ten very different Sunday brunch experiences Furthermore our Sunday brunches are listed in no particular order They are merely presented in the order that we experienced them We are a website that loves to share experiences and below you will find a great many photographs of some of the most tantalizing food known to man We sampled items like traditional Scottish haggis blue corn pancakes with desert honey agave syrup lamb skewers eggs benedict lobster mac cheese to corn flake crusted french toast 5 spice pumpkin french toast and lemon souffle french toast And perhaps best of all the mind boggling display of desserts was enough to put a huge smile on anyone who draws a breath We invite you to spend some time ogling all of our photographs Further we would recommend that you make it your plan to eventually visit each and every one of these Sunday brunches They have been prepared by a formidable collection of noteworthy chefs Enjoy Week 1 Sunday Brunch at Il Terrazzo The Phoenician

Become a Routine Manufacturing Tool 3-d printing will soon become a routine manufacturing tool | mit technology review"",""body"":""General Electric is making a radical departure from the way it has traditionally manufactured things Its aviation division the world s largest supplier of jet engines is preparing to produce a fuel nozzle for a new aircraft engine by printing the part with lasers rather than casting and welding the metal The technique known as additive manufacturing because it builds an object by adding ultrathin layers of material one by one could transform how GE designs and makes many of the complex parts that go into everything from gas turbines to ultrasound machines Additive manufacturing the industrial version of 3 D printing is already used to make some niche items such as medical implants and to produce plastic prototypes for engineers and designers But the decision to mass produce a critical metal alloy part to be used in thousands of jet engines is a significant milestone for the technology And while 3 D printing for consumers and small entrepreneurs has received a great deal of publicity it is in manufacturing where the technology could have its most significant commercial impact see The Difference Between Makers and Manufacturers January February 2013 Last fall GE purchased a pair of companies with know how in automated precision manufacturing of metals and then folded the technology into the operations of GE Aviation That group doesn t have much time to demonstrate that its new technology can work at scale CFM International GE s joint venture with France s Snecma will use the 3 D printed nozzles in its LEAP jet engine due to go into planes in late 2015 or early 2016 CFM says it already has commitments of 22 billion Each engine will use 10 to 20 nozzles GE needs to make 25 000 of the nozzles annually within three years GE chose the additive process for manufacturing the nozzles because it uses less material than conventional techniques That reduces GE s production costs and because it makes the parts lighter yields significant fuel savings for airlines Conventional techniques would require welding about 20 small pieces together a labor intensive process in which a high percentage of the material ends up being scrapped Instead the part will be built from a bed of cobalt chromium powder A computer controlled laser shoots pinpoint beams onto the bed to melt the metal alloy in the desired areas creating 20 micrometer thick layers one by one The process is a faster way to make complex shapes because the machines can run around the clock And additive manufacturing in general conserves material because the printer can handle shapes that eliminate unnecessary bulk and create them without the typical waste The rest of GE together with its competitors is watching closely GE Power Water which makes large gas and wind turbines has already identified parts it can make with the additive process and GE Healthcare has developed a method to print transducers the expensive ceramic probes used in ultrasound machines It s really fundamentally changing the way we think about the company says Mark Little GE s chief technology officer Breaking with traditional manufacturing techniques such as casting and machining material gives GE product designers far greater flexibility Additive manufacturing machines work directly from a computer model so people can devise completely new shapes without regard for existing manufacturing limitations We can make configurations that we just couldn t before Little says GE engineers are starting to explore how to use additive manufacturing with a wider range of metal alloys including some materials specifically designed for 3 D printing GE Aviation for one is looking to use titanium aluminum and nickel chromium alloys A single part could be made of multiple alloys letting designers tailor its material characteristics in a way that s not possible with casting A blade for an engine or turbine for example could be made with different materials so that one end is optimized for strength and the other for heat resistance All that is still on paper or rather in the computerized designs of product engineers For now GE s engine nozzle a part small enough to fit in the palm of your hand will be the first big test of whether additive manufacturing can revolutionize the way complex high performance products are made ge, the world\u2019s largest manufacturer, is on the verge of using 3-d printing to make jet parts. ge, the world\u2019s largest

for life Originally the term detox diet was used in the treatment of people who had become dependent on drugs and alcohol With the growing awareness of alternative medicines for healing the body and the development of various kinds of weight loss diets the term is used for any cleansing diet that helps in detoxifying the body A body Cleansing Diet is done over a short term and involves a change in eating and drinking habits in an attempt to detoxify the body by getting rid of toxins or other contaminants A popular side effect or benefit is weight loss but many people claim an improvement in overall health The most common benefits being increased energy improved immune system and resistance to disease improved mental clarity and better digestion Why do a Detox Diet Few of us have systems that are well balanced because of the lifestyles we live We don t eat healthy food and we dont get enough rest or exercise So our bodies dont function as smoothly as they should We are exposed daily to pollutants and toxins Some from our environment and others are internal toxins produced as the byproduct of our digestive and metabolic processes Toxic and unwanted inorgranic chemicals are found in our foods water and air in the form of fertilizers pesticides heavy metals and other pollutants At home and at work we are exposed to all sorts of airborne micro organisms and debris paint and carpet fumes Everything from plastic containers to dry cleaned clothes to skin and haircare products and cosmetics bombard our bodies with unwanted pollutants All of these fall in the category of environmental toxins Our bodies also produce toxins through normal digestion and metabolism If your body has the proper nutrition in sufficient quantities to provide a healthy biochemistry and if the organs of elimination and detoxification are functioning at optimal levels your body is able to naturally eliminate these toxins safely and efficiently through cellular processes via the main organs of detoxification skin bowels liver kidneys and lungs This manifests as elimination through perspiration bowel elimination urination and respiration However if the body is producing and taking in more toxins than it can safely eliminate a state of chronic toxicity may occur Cleansing diets are designed to help your body rid itself of the toxic matter build up and lose weight If you feel sluggish have frequent colds digestive problems or just arent feeling your best you may have a toxicity issue A detox diet will help you clean the harmful matter from your body and lose weight Choosing a Cleansing Diet Detoxification is a process and can be a gentle cleansing ora more rigorous therapy where many foods are completelyavoided over a long period of time The detoxifying program you would choose would depend for themost part on the condition of your elimination system and yourover all health The good news is that you are not stuck with fasting as the only method of cleansing your body In fact it s now beleived that the liver is unable to cope with a full fast because the pollution of our food and environment is so bad Fasting can release too many toxins into the bloodstream at once so a gentler cleansing program may be a better option It s also more likely that you ll stick to a less stringent detoxification program Master Cleanse Diet Secrets Popular Detoxification Diets include Colon cleansing diets liquid cleansing diets and liver cleanse diets Liver and colon detoxes are growing in popularity as more consumers learn to avoid illness through proper prevention measures such as intestinal cleaning and detoxification In 1985 between 60 and 70 million Americans were affected by digestive disorders Today it s close to 100 million Colorectal cancer one of the most severe digestive or gastro enterological diseases is the second leading cause of cancer deaths Other methods of detoxifying are saunas and baths More Detox Diet Information Make an informed

obsession with sugar salt and fat our obsession with sugar, salt and fat - cnn.com our obsession with sugar, salt and fat"",""body"":""Did you know that the food industry has created different kinds of salt to fit their specific products STORY HIGHLIGHTS Average American eats 33 pounds of cheese and 70 pounds of sugar a year The optimum amount of sugar in a product is known as the bliss point Food industry is hooked on salt author says as a miracle ingredient to solve problems Expert says it s more difficult for people to control their eating habits than narcotics TIME com In his new book Salt Sugar Fat Pulitzer Prize winning investigative reporter Michael Moss takes readers on a tour of the 1 trillion processed food industry and the sights aren t pretty The average American eats 33 pounds of cheese and 70 pounds of sugar a year and health experts say those trends triggered the obesity epidemic that has left millions at risk of heart disease diabetes and other chronic health conditions Based on his interviews with top industry executives from Kraft to Coca Cola as well as leading food scientists Moss discusses how we became so dependent on processed food How does covering the food industry compare to your other investigative reporting projects In some ways the food companies are fortresses They share so little of what they do with nosy reporters At the same time I kind of discovered that food companies are in some ways are like hotels When you really start meeting the people inside who work there there are few precious secrets People really do love to talk about their work I was also incredibly fortunate to come across thousands and thousands of pages of internal documents that shed huge light on the dark corners in the processed food industry and convinced some of the key executives to talk me It s pretty widely known that sugary cereals and Cheese Whiz are not good for you What surprised you One of the things that really surprised me was how concerted and targeted the effort is by food companies to hit the magical formulation Take sugar for example The optimum amount of sugar in a product became known as the bliss point Food inventors and scientists spend a huge amount of time formulating the perfect amount of sugar that will send us over the moon and send products flying off the shelves It is the process they ve engineered that struck me as really stunning When it came to fat it was the amazing role of what the industry calls the mouth feel That s the warm gooey taste of cheese or the bite into a crisp fried chicken that you get It rushes right to the same pleasure centers of the brain that sugar does but fat is carrying twice as many calories so it is more problematic from an obesity standpoint There is almost no limit to the bliss point in fat If there is one it s up in heavy cream some place So the companies discovered they could add as much fat as they wanted to products and unless people looked closely at the nutrition facts they are going to totally love it more than they would without the fat When it comes to salt what was really staggering to me is that the industry itself is totally hooked on salt It is this miracle ingredient that solves all of their problems There is the flavor burst to the salt itself but it also serves as a preservative so foods can stay on the shelves for months It also masks a lot of the off notes in flavors that are inherent to processed foods TIME com Why are Americans still obese After all your research do you believe these foods can be considered addictive That is the one single word that the food industry hates addiction They much prefer words like crave ability and allure Some of the top scientists who are very knowledgeable about addiction in the country are very convinced that for some people the most highly sugared high fat foods are every bit as addictive as some narcotics Their advice to these people is don t try to eat just a couple Oreo cookies because you are not going to be able to stop Sugar uses the same neurological pathways as narcotic products rely on to hit the pleasure center of the brain that send out the signals eat more eat more That said the food industry defends itself by saying true narcotic addiction has certain technical thresholds that you just don t find in food addiction It s true but in some ways getting unhooked on foods is harder than getting unhooked on narcotics because you can t go cold turkey You can t just stop eating The head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse in Washington says that it s more difficult for people to control their eating habits than narcotics She is hugely empathic with overeaters In your book you talk about how the industry fiddles with the physical shapes of ingredients like fat and salt so they taste better on the tongue How are companies using this process Cargill among other companies make numerous versions of salt to meet the particular needs of their customers and their products I had this vision of salt as chunks coming out of the ground and then thrown into a box But in fact they re manipulated to work perfectly with every special product There are powdered salts chunked salts salts shaped in different ways with various additives to work perfectly with processed foods All of them are geared to increase allure My favorite is the one called the kosher salt It looks like snow but is shaped like a pyramid with flat sides that enable it to stick to food better But where the magic comes in is that it s hollowed out so your saliva has more contact with the salt Your saliva is what conveys the salt taste to the taste buds which send the electric signals to your brain The kosher salt also dissolves three times as fast as regular salt so you re getting a much larger hit of what the companies call the flavor burst I thought that was truly fascinating You focus heavily on the success of Lunchables to appeal to kids What fascinated you about their creation Lunchables was an incredible stroke of marketing genius Especially when they came up with the idea of making pizza Lunchables They asked mothers whether they thought their kids would eat this cold pizza that they assembled themselves and the mothers said Are you kidding me That sounds so awful But when they turned to the kids and asked Hey what do you guys think the kids said Yeah That sounds really interesting They realized that the overwhelming attraction to the Lunchables wasn t the taste It s the empowerment It s about letting kids have control and manipulate what they re eating They came up with this brilliant Lunchable slogan which was All day you have to do what they say but lunch time is all yours That resonated deeply with children and sales just went through the roof The darker side of Lunchables is that it brought fast food into the grocery store which has become a real concern given the obesity crisis The CDC put out a recent report saying consumption of fast food has declined from 13 of our calories to 11 There is some reason to believe that it was due to the recession because people were trying to cut back on going out to eat The question is what are they substituting for that fast food If you look at grocery stores in the last decade or more there s been an increase in foods that try and emulate fast foods It s like the industry has moved into the grocery store TIME com Cutting soda curbs children s weight gain Were you surprised by how many scientists and food company executives avoid their own products It was everything from a former top scientist at Kraft saying he used to maintain his weight by jogging and then he blew out his knee and couldn t exercise his solution was to avoid sugar and all caloric drinks including all the Kool Aid and sugary drinks that Kraft makes It ranged from him to the former top scientist at Frito Lay I spent days at his house going over documents relating to his efforts at Frito Lay to push the company to cut back on salt He served me plain cooked oatmeal and raw asparagus for lunch We toured his kitchen and he did not have one single processed food product in his cupboards or refrigerator The scientists and executives were pretty honest about their roles in creating unhealthy food Did you get the impression they felt guilty about their products One reason they don t eat their own products is that they know better They know about the addictive properties of sugar salt and fat As insiders they know too much I think a lot of them have come to feel badly But not blaming themselves necessarily because the older ones invented a number of these products back in the days when dependency on them was much lower In the 70s and the 80s for example we were eating more home cooked meals from scratch and eating more mindfully As society evolved and we became more dependent on these conveniences these people came to see their work with real misgivings The inventor of the Lunchables Bob Drane wishes mightily that the nutritional aspects of that product could ve been made better He is still hoping it will be made better They came to have regrets about their work in the context of the health effects their products seem to have that go hand in hand with society s increasing demand of their products You highlight some examples of companies trying to make their food healthier Are there any changes you find particularly positive I was really struck by the concerted effort by Kraft to embrace an anti obesity initiative At first they tried to rally the whole industry to collectively cut back and try to fight obesity including down formulating the amount of salt sugar and fats they were using But when that failed and the rest of the companies refused to join Kraft set off on its own It cut back on its marketing of sugary products to children and rejiggered it s packaging so it would tell people how much salt sugar and fat in calories were in each package not just in a tiny little serving The most revolutionary thing was that they ordered their food scientists to limit the salt sugar and fat in their products This was a company where every ounce of their effort for decades and decades had gone into making products as hugely appealing and addictive as possible Mind you these are not companies that want people to get fat or unhealthy that s not in their business interests but they do want people to buy as much of their products as they possibly can To have Kraft then say to itself Wait a minute maybe there s some other competing interest to pay attention to was mind blowing Ultimately they ran into the problem that the whole industry faces which is the huge pressure from Wall Street and the investment community to increase profits TIME com The 31 healthiest foods of all time What do you think is the greatest obstacle standing in the way of federal regulation of salt sugar and fat I think the USDA is badly conflicted It has multiple missions and one of the biggest is to support the agricultural industry This plays out most significantly in the area of cheese and beef The USDA has become a partner with the dairy industry and the beef industry in promoting increased consumption of cheese and red meat at a time when its own nutritionists are encouraging people to cut back because both are heavily laden with saturated fat which is linked to heart disease This largely explains why cheese consumption has tripled in this country since the 70s to as much as 33 pounds per person per year On the flipside the USDA has this tiny little operation that creates things like the food pyramid and dietary guidelines to encourage people to limit their consumption of saturated fat but the budget for those efforts is miniscule compared to budget for promoting consumption One of the key things for moving forward is that the playing field needs to be leveled in terms of pricing We all know we should be eating more fresh vegetables and fresh fruits When you hit that part of the store and you see that blueberries cost 5 for a little basket and you can wheel over to the center of the store and see all these power bars and seemingly healthy things that are in fact loaded with salt sugar and fat and they are half the price or a third the price and there are all these other things that can fill up your cart for much less money That s a really difficult thing for families to deal with Everyone is convinced that the government subsidies that support processed food need to be shifted over in some way to fresh fruits and vegetables or it s going to continue to be hard for even people who want to eat better to do so financially Do you think there s any change in sight I think we are at a real tipping point here What I hear from people inside the food industry is that the food giants are scared to death right now The pressure from Wall Street on profits has never been greater The pressure from consumers for better healthier products has never been greater The pressure from the White House to do something to fight obesity is increasing The other problem they re having is that they ve cut way back on the pure science and research that they used to do and so many of the scientists I ve talked to are pleading with these companies to start putting more money into inventing new products that both taste good and are healthy I think that will be key to getting out of this mess we are in Have any of your eating and purchasing habits changed since writing this I have two boys age 8 and 13 and it certainly makes things difficult My wife like so many people works outside the home like I do and our mornings are totally crazy That said we ve been working on breakfast We get the boys to eat 100 whole wheat toast and they really don t notice the difference between white bread and wheat We arbitrarily set a limit on cereals of 5g of sugar per serving which they find kind of fun because they can go into the cereal aisles and hunt for cereals that have that much sugar or less They may have to reach low or reach high to find them because they re not at eye level but basic Cherrios have one gram per serving which is fantastic and they love it If you engage kids in the process of getting healthier they rise to the occasion They are smart and they re eager TIME com Make over your diet in one week Do you have any advice for people going into the grocery store who want to eat healthier Make a list and stick to it Some of the plotting done by grocery stores and food manufacturers is to get you into situations where you are making spontaneous decisions That s when the soda and the sugary foods around the check counter get sold most heavily Spend more time on the ends of the supermarket near the fresh vegetable and fresh fruit aisle and look for things that are affordable When you get into the center aisle be careful in the middle part because that s the highest selling area and where they put the most heavily laden salt and sugary products Also look first at the front of the packaging That s where they hit you with things like low fat and low sugar and added calcium and vitamin this and vitamin that Take those as warning signs When they say low fat it s often loaded with sugar to make up for the reduction in fat Or likewise low salt is often loaded with sugar and fat to make up for the low salt When they splash the phrase added calcium on the front that s often a signal that the thing is loaded in all three of the pillars Lastly spend some time with the nutrition facts box It has to be on every package now It can be really revealing as to what exactly is in the package Pay attention to the number of servings per container because the companies know that people will typically eat a package of cookies that has three servings in it all at once You have to do the math yourself because they will list the nutrient content based on one serving which will dramatically understate the amount of nutrient load you re getting by eating the package Very few of us can avoid processed foods all together Our lives will not allow it I m certainly in that category But ultimately we are the ones who decide what to buy what to eat and how much to eat and that s a very powerful thing when we walk into the grocery store I hope the book can help people to understand everything the food giants are throwing at you in terms of formulating marketing and advertising I think you come away feeling more empowered to take control of that decision making process yourself

pizza"",""body"":""I ve never met anyone who didn t like pizza This economic migrant from impoverished Naples is the epitome of the American dream popularised by the Italian community adapted to suit new world tastes and then exported around the world it s the ultimate immigrant success story Of course Italians can t take all the credit for what is quite simply the world s best snack as the Oxford Companion to Food points out the linguistic link between pizza and pitta is surely no coincidence topped breads have been popular around the Mediterranean since classical times and Etruscans were baking schiacciata in the Tuscan region over 2 000 years ago The modern conception of pizza however is largely based on the Neapolitan version not as crisp as the Roman variety the base should be soft and pliable yet charred and chewy around the edge Far from the embarrassment of toppings loaded on to the deep dish pizza pies of Chicago the true Neapolitan pizza has the mere whisper of a garnish to set off its freshly baked charms The city s famous Da Michele pizzeria opened in 1870 with just one thing on the menu marinara tomatoes garlic and herbs After Queen Margherita visited the region 19 years later it grudgingly expanded its offering to include the new trend tomatoes mozzarella and basil and so it remains today the only nod to modern excess is a doppio mozzarella Pizza as the American food writer Jeffrey Steingarten discovered in his quest for the perfect version is a creature of the heat the Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana pdf insists that to earn its seal of approval they must be baked on the floor of a wood fired oven at 485 C Sadly most of us don t have one of these knocking around in a corner of the kitchen so I m going to be working within the necessary limitations of the average home cook on the basis that although the results will never be as good as the pizzas at Da Michele s they will almost certainly be far better than a pizza bought chilled at the supermarket or which has spent 15 minutes steaming gently in a box on the back of a scooter Giorgio Locatelli explains in Made in Italy that pizza has to have the perfect balance between a thin crisp base and a softer garnish which is why you have to eat it within 5 6 minutes of it coming out of the oven or it will be soggy and spoilt This he says is why in Italy pizza comes from the bakers or street vendors not even if they threatened you with six years in prison would you eat a takeaway pizza delivered on a motorbike Case closed The language of floursThe Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana hereafter to be known as AVPN is typically strict on this point specifying finely milled 00 flour although what it doesn t point out assuming possibly that anyone even pretending to authenticity would know is that it comes in different strengths pizza flour as its sometimes known in Italy is 00 with a higher gluten content than that used for pastry and so on Silver Spoon recipe pizza Photograph Felicity Cloake This is worth knowing although not if you re using the recipe from Italian cookery bible The Silver Spoon which calls for plain flour preferably Italian type 00 suggesting the milling rather than the strength is what informs that preference The dough is tacky and difficult to handle but the finished result is good chewy crunchy on the underside and with a pleasant flavour The pizzette recipe in Locatelli s Made in Italy meanwhile opts for strong white bread flour in his restaurants he says they use Italian extra strong W300 P L 0 55 but this isn t readily available outside its homeland As he observes the dough is very soft and sticky to the extent that I find his folding technique difficult and once baked the pizza is although tasty rather tough there s no meltingly soft middle here River Cottage recipe pizza Photograph Felicity Cloake River Cottage baker Daniel Stevens uses an equal mix of strong and plain white flour in an echo of Locatelli s suggested alternative of 00 and strong bread flour It s quite fluffy even when I defy instructions and roll it out thinner than the 5mm specified but definitely softer in texture than my previous efforts River Cafe recipe pizza Photograph Felicity Cloake The River Cafe Classic Italian Cookbook goes out on a limb with a recipe borrowed from California s Chez Panisse which uses a rye flour sponge left to ferment for about half an hour before being combined with a strong flour dough This one seems distinctly bready and heavy to me and the rye gives it an unwelcome wholesome flavour It sticks out like a sore thumb this is pizza California hippy style Jamie Oliver suggests a mix of strong flour and semolina the latter apparently gives the dough an authentic flavour and texture Mine turns out a bit like a cracker however undoubtedly tasty as a snack food but not terribly Neapolitan Heston Blumenthal on his own quest for perfection plumps for 100 pizza flour aka strong 00 and makes a small batch of dough the day before which due to the longer fermentation time has had time to really develop flavour Adding this to the mix certainly gives the base a more assertive slightly tangy character It has a good texture too chewy around the edge distinctly more yielding in the centre I decide that as I m after a soft base with a slight crunch to it strong 00 flour is the way to go and I ll keep Jamie s semolina to dust the base with to add a bit of interest to the texture A state of ferment Jamie Oliver recipe pizza Photograph Felicity Cloake Jamie s recipe is the quickest of the lot the dough rests for a mere 15 minutes before dividing and rolling and I wonder if this could be to blame for its failure to rise and slightly anodyne flavour As far as I can tell the longer the ferment the more complex the flavour of the base I m not looking for something that s going to compete with the topping but as it s the principal element of the dish it should be able to stand alone if necessary with perhaps just a little olive oil and salt Twenty four hours seems a little excessive although it won t harm the finished product and after a little experimentation with a batch of dough I decide four hours is sufficient to send my bases out in the world with a robust flavour and enough rise to ensure a beautifully light crust Sourdough pizzas as practiced by Brixton s Franco Manca are trendy right now and with good reason the flavours are superb but I m given to understand that not everyone has a starter hanging around in their fridge Other ingredients Locatelli recipe pizza I said the dough was hard to work with Photograph Felicity Cloake The AVPN permits only four ingredients in Neapolitan pizza dough water salt yeast and flour In fact it goes as far as to specifically outlaw all types of fat Locatelli adds extra virgin olive oil and the River Cafe use milk as well I find these make the dough too soft to work with however pizza dough ought to be elastic enough to stretch under its own weight given that s how the professionals shape it but the Made in Italy one is seriously hard to handle I decide to save the oil for the topping instead in theory the dough should have enough flavour without it Heston adds malt syrup to his dough which stumps me until I discover that this is quite common in Italy it simply helps the crust to brown and sugar is often substituted if malt is unavailable I find it in a health food shop but given my limited skills as a pizzaiolo the pizza s aesthetic appearance is the least of my worries so I leave this out too In line with the AVPN s principles if not their recipe I m trying my hardest to keep things simple Hot hot heat Heston s inverted frying pan pizza stone replacement technique Photograph Felicity Cloake As previously mentioned the insurmountable hurdle faced by the home baker is their oven they simply aren t hot enough However there are things you can do to help it out To mimic the floor of a wood oven Heston preheats an empty pan and then slides the pizza on to the red hot base before putting it under the grill I burn myself twice while attempting this and although there s more authentic charring on the sides I find it s all too easy to overcook the top while waiting for the base to harden with this technique Better I think is a pizza stone or and more cheaply a terracotta saucer heated in the oven which must I m afraid go on about an hour before you want to cook turned as high as it will go the ingredients for pizza may be cheap but the fuel sadly isn t I ve also heard good things about pizzas cooked on the floor of AGAs but tickled as I am by the concept of a Neapolitan peasant dish coming out of a rural British stove I can t vouch for this personally It s important to add the toppings as soon as possible before cooking so they don t make the dough soggy especially if you re using mozzarella and to slide the pizza as quickly as you can on to the hot surface which is another reason why dusting the bottom with semolina makes sense Then all you can do is wait and pray and get ready with the plates Perfect pizza Felicity s perfect pizza Photograph Felicity Cloake Pizza is well worth making at home it s easy fun and perfect to tear into with your fingers All you need is a hot oven and a light and flavoursome dough the rest is entirely up to you Makes 6 8

toppingsOlive oil and semolina flour to serve1 Mash together the yeast and sugar and leave for 1 minute Stir into the water then add to the flour and mix in a food processor on the lowest speed for about 4 minutes until it comes together into a soft dough Add the salt and then turn the speed up slightly and mix for another 4 minutes Alternatively mix them together with a wooden spoon then turn the dough out on to a work surface add the salt and knead for 10 minutes 2 Put the dough into a large lightly oiled bowl and turn over to coat Cover with a damp cloth or cling film and leave in a warm place for four hours 3 Divide the dough into satsuma sized pieces and roll into balls on the worksurface using the palm of your hand Put on a lightly oiled baking tray cover and store somewhere cool until you re ready to cook if you don t want to use it all the dough should keep at this point for about a fortnight if properly sealed but don t divide it up until you re going to use it 4 Turn the oven to its highest setting and add your seasoned a new stone should come with seasoning instructions pizza stone terracotta or heavy baking tray Allow to heat for about an hour to make sure there are absolutely no cold spots 5 Dust a worksurface with a little flour and put a ball of dough on to it Flatten it using your hand then knock the air out of it with your fingertips Lift it up on to your fingertips and rotate it stretching it out as you go until it s as thin as possible leaving a thicker ring of dough around the edges 6 Slide on to a rimless baking tray or pizza paddle dusted with semolina and working as quickly as possible add the toppings and a drizzle of olive oil Slide on to the hot surface and cook for about 8 minutes keeping an eye on them until crisp and golden Devour

transactions maybe we wouldn t get heisted Debit Card Swipe Dan Nosowitz Yesterday federal prosecutors in Brooklyn revealed that an international team of thieves had stolen close to 45 million in the biggest ATM fraud case in history The heist required some hacking and a lot of orchestration so news organizations and police forces have been calling it high tech and sophisticated Which it isn t really It s possible because the US yes specifically the US is wildly behind the times in terms of transactional security relying on a 50 year old technology How did they do it Hackers first broke into the system of a company in India that handles pre paid debit cards kind of like gift cards They raised or eliminated the withdrawal limit on those cards usually just a few hundred dollars and jotted down the identifying data for these new illicit cards to be The heist until this point was all digital a theft of modifying and stealing information rather than actual money The money part came thanks to the decades old magnetic strip technology The thieves evidently had a magnetic card reader writer the same kind hotels use to imprint code on magnetic room keys Using any card with a magnetic strip old credit cards hotel keys hell you could use a driver s license though you wouldn t want to use your own they imprinted this new data Now that old credit card is activated carrying an invented code that will tell an ATM that it can withdraw a basically unlimited amount of money The thieves shipped these new cards out all over the world Dozens probably hundreds of associates on cue hit ATMs All over Manhattan and in two dozen other countries old cards masquerading as high level gift cards withdrew money The cash was used to buy expensive items Rolexes cars for laundering purposes The best part Those original hackers could see exactly how much each of their invented codes was withdrawing None of the associates could skim The prosecutor compared it to the movie Ocean s 11 but really it was closer to Ocean s 13 a movie in which the thieves took down a casino s security system and rigged every game on the floor leading to a manic blitz How is this possible Well the magnetic stripe card was invented by IBM in 1960 Magnetic stripe cards work by changing the magnetism of tiny iron based particles kind of like a Woolly Willy They can be wiped and reset by cheap reader writers which you can buy for about 200 bucks Typically magnetic stripe pre paid cards come with PIN numbers but that doesn t provide any security at all when the thief is the one creating the card and the PIN which is what happened with this heist Pretty much every other developed country got rid of magnetic stripe cards years ago and many countries are multiple generations beyond that tech In the UK and much of Europe the chip and PIN card properly called the EMV for Europay MasterCard and Visa is dominant it s a regular plastic card but it s embedded with a tiny computer chip that serves as authentication in conjunction with a regular four digit PIN The EMV system is much more secure than the magnetic stripe card when it was introduced to France the country saw an 80 reduction in card fraud It was introduced in 1992 by the way The France of 20 years ago was more advanced than the US is now The benefits authentication is far more sophisticated than reading a simple magnetized strip it incorporates actual encryption protocols like DES the Data Encryption Standard The chief vulnerability of the EMV system IT STILL HAS MAGNETIC STRIPES EMV cards have a magnetic stripe so they can be used in dumber slower countries like the US which can t read the chips The only real hack of the EMV system relies on transferring information from the magnetic stripe rather than the chip Japan s current standard is FeliCa made by Sony it s an RFID chip so it s contactless and benefits from some even more advanced security Sony announced that the next generation FeliCa standard would use AES or the Advanced Encryption Standard What about the future Hell not even the future right now digital wallets are taking off in other countries Osaifu Keitai in Japan embeds FeliCa into phones from Japanese wireless carrier NTT DoCoMo It d be like your Verizon phone had all your Visa info That system uses near field communication or NFC to trigger transactions Tap your phone on a point of sale device enter a PIN and your money s transferred NFC isn t even new modern Android phones and many Windows Phones have it right now So why is the US so far behind Infrastructure is a major factor countries like Japan and the UK are much smaller so replacing all the old point of sale machines and ATMs is easier Another problem is that American banks don t really care enough to invest in new infrastructure and the US government has an awful lot of trouble making the banks do anything they d rather not do Lots of modern heists rely on old school methods The amazing computer hacker thief isn t really the norm the world s most successful jewel heist ring the Pink Panthers are smash and grab artists And this card fraud does require hacking but it couldn t happen if the US transaction system didn t rely on a decades old authentication system that can be negated with something you buy from Amazon yesterday, federal prosecutors in brooklyn revealed that

a sleepover while my girls go to Hy s house for a sleepover Food wise I churn out two meals for the dudes during the time they re here breakfast food for dinner and dinner food for breakfast Boys drive a hard bargain man They ll eat you out of house and home It s actually shocking sometimes Girls on the other hand eat apple slices and carrot sticks and cubes of cheese and Triscuits and they re totally blissfully happy I enjoy being a girl Meat Boys like meat This is one of the things I make on the show It s one of Marlboro Man s favorite things in the entire world Here s the step by step recipe Yummy Steak Bites Printable recipe below To go with the steak I make these perfect sunny side up eggs They re so easy to make and are almost artificial looking once you re finished with them Think the display case at Denny s or IHOP Here s the benefit to this sunny side up method With true sunny side up eggs you crack an egg into a skillet and let it cook until the underside is done However because the top of the egg never touches the heat at all the whites can be on the slimy side and the yolks can be way too runny and cool Some people like eggs like this Rocky Balboa for example But I don t happen to be one of them One method for remedying this involves steaming the eggs by sticking the lid on the skillet while the eggs are cooking But I like this method better Probably because it involves fat I m sorry I have to be me Important You need a nonstick skillet I ve tried this method with regular skillets and it just never works for me Add a small amount of canola oil to the skillet not enough to have much depth to it at all Note you can also use butter OR bacon grease if you re into those sorts of things But those bring along some particles and some color and you won t wind up with as pristine an egg Not that that really matters in the grand scheme of human history but I thought I d mention it Heat the canola oil over medium heat You don t want it too too hot as you re going to cook the eggs pretty slowly You don t want the oil so hot that the egg sizzles and turns white the second you crack it in The whites should remain clear for several seconds before they start to turn white Sorry to be bossy I ve had lots of trial and error with this one and I want to save you the emotional pain Oh and one other thing I snapped some of these very photos as I was filming the segment for the TV show a few of them were taken weeks earlier so I missed photographing some steps along the way I blame my nervousness in front of the camera my preoccupation with my hair and my third grade teacher So here s what you do 1 Once the oil is mildly hot crack in an egg Note three is about as many as I can tend to at a time The oil should not cover the whites if anything it should just come over the edges a tiny bit 2 Once the eggs begin to turn white use a small spoon to carefully spoon the hot oil over the whites only Go from egg to egg spooning the oil over the whites This will help the whites cook slowly so that they won t be slimy Important Don t spoon any oil over the yolks yet 3 After a minute or two touch the whites of one of the eggs and make sure they re set not jiggly and loose At that time you can spoon oil over the yolks to help them set on the surface Note The reason you need to wait before spooning hot oil over the yolks is that immediately after cracking the eggs into the pan there is still egg white covering the yolk If you were to spoon the hot oil over the yolk immediately it would cause the white on the yolk to turn white which will result in the yolk having a cloudy covering like the yolk in these two photos And that s a tragic thing On the other hand if you wait the egg will settle into the skillet and the whites will sheet over the sides of the yolk and eventually leave mostly yolk there So a minute or two into the process if you spoon the hot oil over the yolk you won t get that cloudy appearance To repeat the two photos above are a cautionary tale I m exhausted 4 Continue spooning the oil over the egg until it appears to be as done as you d like You can gauge it by lightly jiggling it or poking it with the spoon 5 Remove the eggs from the pan with a slotted spatula then this is important drain them briefly on a paper towel before serving I fold a paper towel and hold it in my left hand then place the egg on the towel with my right hand then I just slide it onto the plate You can also just keep the egg on the spatula and pat the bottom of the spatula on the paper towel to try to get most of the oil off the egg And that s it This is a neato method guys Once I learned it and practiced a bit I had some fun with it It s particularly fun if you re cooking for guests and you want your breakfast dish to look really yummy and inviting It s also great for foodbloggers or food stylists who need picture perfect eggs But it s also a lot of fun for kids because the eggs stay bright yellow and white and look like well like fake eggs which kids get a kick out of The only thing you really need to keep an eye on is the oil fat and making sure you dab it drain it off as much as you can Enjoy Recipe Perfect Sunny Side Up Eggs Prep Time 2 Minutes Cook Time 5 Minutes Difficulty Easy Servings 3 Ingredients 3 whole Eggs4 Tablespoons Canola Oil more Or Less As Needed For Size

and freshly ground pepper Toss the meat around a bit to thoroughly coat with the seasonings Next turn on your ventilation fan overhead Heat the skillet over medium high to high heat As the pan heats add about 2 tablespoons butter to the skillet Allow the butter to melt then brown before you add the meat Place some of the meat in the pan in a single layer It should sizzle loudly when it hits the pan if it doesn t the pan isn t hot enough Don t stir or disrupt the meat for 30 45 seconds You want it to sizzle and brown on one side Scoop as many steak bites as you can with your spatula and flip them over Repeat until all the meat is turned Cook for an additional 30 to 45 seconds just long enough to sear the outside of the meat but NOT cook the inside Remove the meat to a clean plate Add a little more butter to the pan and repeat the cooking process with the next batch just as before Lastly when all the meat is nicely browned and removed to the plate pour all that browned blackened butter all over the meat And enjoy Posted by Ree on August 3 2009 "",""url"":""thepioneerwoman

"http://www.pastrypal.com/2009/11/19/quadruple-chocolate-cake/"	"9202"	"{""title"":""Chocolate Cake "",""body"":""November 19th 2009 56 Comments If you promise them chocolate cake you better make sure they get it Or there will be bedlam I learned first hand We ran out during one busy dinner service and there was so much uproar the kitchen transformed into an urban Lord of the Flies These cakes were more than just popular People traveled to have them Faced with no cake they threatened to write letters to the mayor or worse The waiters eyes were black with fury for being forced to break it to the guests Some diners were so filled with denial they sent their waiter back to the kitchen to make sure we were really out as though we were peddling capri pants and we simply had another size available in the back All night we argued bargained offered substitutions freebies savings bonds to no avail The people weren t pleased It was a dark day in history that I never wanted to repeat A few months later when our restaurant s mixing bowl groaned its last breath we went into a panic not seen since the Barney s sample sale Mind you this was not a KitchenAid sized mixing bowl It was an industrial model that occupied a vast corner of the restaurant floor and was prior to that day able to mash up a hundred pounds of dough at a time Our daily agenda included mixing dozens of these signature chocolate cakes most of which would sell out over the course of the night Making small batches was out of the question We d have needed to bend the laws of physics to coax more hours out of the day Someone had to think quick Without hesitation one of the more accomplished pastry assistants jumped to his feet ran over to the sink and started scrubbing up like a surgeon I watched him wash his entire arms from wrist to shoulder He grabbed the bowl which stood waist high next to his rather short stature and dumped beast bags of flour sugar and the usual cakey what nots into it Before I could protest he plunged his tatooed limbs into the batter and started swirling his whole self around I could see through the kicked up cloud of flour dust that it was like working through quicksand so heavy and resistant But he did it And even though he looked like he delivered a calf by the end there were cake pans filled with batter all ready for baking I sure hope for your sake you didn t go to that restaurant that day Certain desserts can make such an impression that they keep worming into your thoughts day in day out This is what happened to Angelynn a dear reader of this blog A few weeks ago she dropped me a note describing her love for this cake and asked me to try to recreate it Now I don t know about you but my fists are too tight to part with 44 plus shipping for a 7 cake so I decided to use it for inspiration only rather than dupe the flavors Mine would be good in its own right and after a few tries it became a cross between the signature cake I once served and the cake Angelynn was dreaming of Admittedly this project is a time sucking doozy since it s based on a cake that has four separate components We ve got the the chocolate cake layers the mousse layers the milk chocolate frosting and whew finally the ganache glaze If you re feeling ambitious the whole bundle would indeed be a show stopper but allow me to suggest the following combinations for a much easier though still tantalizing result just the chocolate cake with a sprinkling of powdered sugar then served with a mound of whipped cream or ice cream the chocolate cake with just the mousse layers the chocolate cake with just the milk chocolate frosting the chocolate cake with just the chocolate glaze which can be used as a chocolate sauce when warmed or throw the cake idea overboard and enjoy just the mousse Then when you re done you can lick your elbows clean By the way I scattered a little chopped peanut brittle from this entry over the top for some crunch Chocolate Cake 1 stick 112g butter1 1 3 cups 257g sugar 1 2 cup 2 tablespoons 56g cocoa powder2 large eggs2 oz 56g dark chocolate melted1 3 4 cups 210g all purpose flour1 teaspoon 4 g baking powder3 4 teaspoon 3 g baking soda1 4 teaspoon 1 gram salt1 2 cup 118 ml water1 2 cup 118 ml milk 1 Gettin ready You can see how sweaty my eggs are in the photo All cold ingredients should be at room temperature for better incorporation Preheat oven to 325 degrees F 2 Melt the chocolate I like to chop it up fine like in the ingredients photo above and melt it in the microwave in 30 second intervals Chocolate burns easily so stir between every zap Mine took about 60 90 seconds to melt Keep on the side 3 Using a tabletop or handheld electric mixer beat the butter sugar and cocoa powder together on medium high speed until smooth creamy and fluffy about 3 minutes Hard to see with the cocoa in the bowl but it went for about 3 minutes 4 Add the eggs one at a time until each one disappears into the mix Be sure to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl Looks like a rising sun no Getting liquidy here Scrape The dry gritty stuff wants to collect at the bottom Don t let it win 5 Pour in the melted chocolate Hopefully by now your chocolate came down in temperature a little It should feel like a warm bath If it s too hot it might melt the butter and that s no good If it s too cold it might re solidify into little bits when it hits the cold bowl So warm We want it warm So far so good Chocolate added 6 In a medium bowl stir together the dry ingredients which include flour baking powder baking soda and salt Stir em up good 7 Combine the milk and the water and microwave them until hot about 45 seconds Like a too hot bath 8 Drop the dry ingredients into the mixing bowl and mix on low speed until MOSTLY combined and then with the machine still running pour in the hot water milk mixture 9 Be sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl again The dry ingredients tend to hide there Here s the finished batter 10 Pour the batter into a parchment lined 9 round baking pan If you need a refresher on lining a round baking pan see the carrot cake post Then bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or almost clean about 40 minutes Let the cake cool completely even for several hours to let the crumb firm up and be less delicate when slicing I like to chill the cake in the fridge for a couple of hours so that slicing goes more smoothly Next make the Chocolate Mousse 8 oz 224g dark chocolate I used 61 El Rey brand 1 stick 112g unsalted butter4 large eggs6 45g tablespoons sugar2 tablespoons water2 3 cup 158 ml heavy cream 1 The bits and pieces required Can you spot where I blotted out the mascarpone that I didn t end up using 2 Working with a large bowl melt the chocolate and butter in the microwave Again use 30 second intervals and stir every time between zaps to make sure the chocolate doesn t burn Set aside 3 Whip cream to a loose peak consistency You can do this with a mixer or by hand It s not exactly liquid anymore but it s not stiff either It should just barely hold streaks I scraped this into another bowl so I could free up my Kitchenaid bowl for the rest of the mousse recipe Refrigerate the cream until we re ready for it 4 Set up a double boiler Fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil Grab a bowl that s big enough to fit over the pot without touching the boiling water and crack in the eggs then pour in the sugar and water Whisk it up and set it over the boiling water Our only goal here is to warm dem eggs Whisk the whole time They ll start to get frothy After a few minutes about 3 move the bowl off the heat and stick your finger in it Yes you heard right This is to gauge the temperature Don t feel like you re after some exact degree of heat It should feel like a very warm bath We are about to whip the crap out of them and warm eggs whip well If they re still cool return to top of pot If they re nice and warm pour into the KitchenAid bowl and whip on high for about 3 minutes If you have a hand mixer or you re whipping by hand go ahead and do it in the bowl you warmed them in The eggs will get very thick pale and creamy looking like so We ll start by pouring about 1 3 of this fluffy egg mixture into the melted chocolate bowl Carefully fold it in scraping from the bottom of the bowl over to the top This will help lighten the very dense chocolate mixture so when we fold in the rest it won t deflate Pour in the rest of the egg mix and fold that in Then add the almost forgotten whipped cream Fold again So much folding it s like laundry day Here s the all folded ready mousse As an aside here s my earlier screw up my first attempt at the mousse You can see all the bits of scrambled eggs floating around Gross indeed I must have let them get away from me when I was busy photographing and trying to whisk at the same time I actually thought it wasn t that bad until I folded in my chocolate and saw the truth magnified before my very eyes Now we can start the assembly 1 Line a 9 springform pan with parchment 2 Peel off the paper that ended up on your cake 3 Slice off the dome by holding a serrated knife parallel to the table and slowly sawing away Dome sliced off Snack on the rejected dome 3 Now we need to slice the rest of the cake in half horizontally I think it s best to eyeball this and you will get better with practice What I like to do is find the center of the cake from top to bottom where my knife is and mentally note the distance from the top edge of the cake as shown by the arrow Run the knife around the edge spinning the cake Don t force the knife it will do it s job slowly As you run the knife around the cake it will cut deeper and deeper until it slices through the center As you can see by the arrow I m always looking at that halfway point to help guide the knife Two mostly even slices If your slices aren t perfectly even no biggie They ll be hidden once the cake is together Set one slice into the prepped springform pan Pour in half the mousse and smooth it out to the edges Carefully place the other cake layer on top and press it down gently Pour the rest of the mousse on and smooth that out over the top as uniformly as possible Freeze this on a flat shelf for at least 4 hours Or overnight Make the milk chocolate frosting Take note that you have to start the frosting a few hours before you plan to frost the cake Right when the cake goes into the freezer is a good time 1 1 4 cup 300 ml heavy cream8 oz 224 g milk chocolate chopped into peas sized bits1 stick 112 g butter1 2 tsp 3 g vanilla extract1 4 cup 30 g powdered sugar 1 Things we need 2 Bring the heavy cream to a boil and pour over the chocolate Allow it to rest for a minute or two to let the heat melt the chocolate Then whisk it up into a sort of loose ganache Refrigerate it until it sets to a soft solid at least 3 hours overnight s ok too 3 When you re ready to frost the cake whip your butter which should be softened to room temperature and vanilla until they re very smooth and creamy 3 4 minutes Scrape down the bowl 4 Add in the set up milk chocolate ganache and powdered sugar and whip until light and fluffy 3 4 minutes I changed to a whip attachment cause it whips better Who knew Finished frosting Now make the chocolate sauce as described in this post This sauce is firm when cold and liquid when warm so it can be used in lots of ways This cake sports it as a glaze for the top and a sauce on the plate You can make it ahead and rewarm it in the microwave at 30 second intervals stirring until you get the consistency you need Finish the assembly 1 Grab the cake from the freezer and run a knife around the edge to release it 2 Carefully release the springform mechanism to free the cake 3 Frost A large offset spatula makes the job easier I have my cake set on some parchment sheets to control the mess Good enough 4 You can decorate in any way Or leave the cake simply frosted I scooped the rest of the frosting into a pastry bag fitted with a plain tip and piped two rows of kisses If you need a refresher on filling a pastry bag see here 5 When the chocolate sauce is lukewarm and ONLY when it s lukewarm stir it up and pour it over the cake to glaze the top If the sauce is too hot when you pour it will melt the frosting underneath making the top look muddled It will probably set quickly because your cake is still giving off frozeness from within so hop to it Viola Refrigerate this until ready to serve up to a day ahead Make sure it s fully defrosted before serving Happy Thursday to me Chocolate Cake 1 stick 112g butter1 1 3 cups 257g sugar 1 2 cup 2 tablespoons 56g cocoa powder2 large eggs2 oz 56g dark chocolate melted1 3 4 cups 210g all purpose flour1 teaspoon 4 g

even a piece of plywood would taste good pan\u00e9ed that s not the starting point of this recipe Although veal is the more common pan\u00e9ed menu item among restaurants at home I prefer to use pork loin slices or boneless skinless chicken breast meat These other cuts of meat have all the advantages of veal with none of the disadvantages including the dryness expense and the way butchers slice veal wrong which is to say they cut veal way to thick And in most cases store bought veal is really not veal at all but calf and calf is much tougher that true veal Pan\u00e9ed medallions of chicken pork or veal are so easily and quickly cooked that you need to get the pasta or side dish finished before starting this process For any recipe that calls for pan\u00e9ed you need to know that the meats are interchangeable such as the veal with chicken or pork substituting any of the proteins will work in any case Pasta bordelaise is the perfect companion to pan\u00e9ed anything although pasta Alfredo is more common in restaurants In this instance I served a side of steamed spinach and also mushrooms in the style of Mushrooms a la Grecque as you can see in the photos and I will post the recipe for this later Traditionally pan\u00e9ed is a term found among New Orleans restaurants and typically means that the meat portion is cut into very thin slices then lightly dusted with flour dipped into an egg wash and then coated with breadcrumbs and pan saut\u00e9ed in oil or butter until golden brown and cooked through You will find several recipes that call for adding a large quantity of oil to the pan and typically this means about a \u00bd inch or so of oil I find this to be way too much oil You only need enough fat to coat the bottom of the pan and usually this means only a couple of tablespoons olive oil or clarified butter In this recipe I am not cutting the chicken into thin slices just pounding it to about a \u00bd inch thickness Traditional pan\u00e9ed veal or pork would have the meat sliced across the grain to about one eighth to \u00bc inch thickness or less We were taught that when cutting veal for a pan\u00e9e you needed to be able to see through the slice or make it almost paper thin of course this was the challenge and rarely matched Thinner is better In this recipe I have used the Progresso Lemon Pepper Panko Breadcrumbs product and the prize pack

small-scale wedding"",""body"":""A lot of couples today are scaling back and searching out small wedding ideas to help them plan a memorable wedding but as a small scale event And when you re shrinking your guest list for whatever reason laminated bookmark favors are a perfect choice for sticking to a cut rate budget but still giving your guests a practical take home thank you gift There are a lot of different reasons for having a smaller wedding the economy being one of the biggest reasons Gas prices have gone up considerably in the last couple of years so sometimes even planning a destination wedding for some couples is out of the question Some couples actually have small families and only want to invite their most intimate friends to their wedding and maybe they re looking for small wedding ideas that will help them plan the day with a more casual tone and without thinking about a lot of travel arrangements for themselves or their guests Easy and Cheap LocationsBackyard weddings or at home ceremonies with outdoor wedding receptions are very popular depending on where you live the climate and the season While you may not want your guests showing up in shorts and tank tops backyard weddings are great for planning activities after the ceremony where your guests can change up into more comfortable clothing for the rest of the day If you or a family member or close friend don t really have the room to set up and accommodate your guests and a buffet and eating area check with local parks to see about renting a pavilion and space for an afternoon Small Wedding Ideas for the MenuPlanning a cheap wedding reception on a small scale is easy if you keep it casual If you re inviting only your close friends and family ask each of them to pitch in with a covered dish and have a pot luck buffet menu Check with local caterers to see if they offer a lunch or picnic buffet at a lower cost than the traditional wedding buffet Sometimes just adding the word wedding to anything will drive up the price But if you don t tell the caterer that it s for a wedding and you re just looking for the standard picnic buffet for X amount of people you can probably save a buck or two a head on the price Or keep it really casual by simply having a backyard barbecue Cheap Wedding Reception EntertainmentIf you re a regular at a local tavern or firehouse check to see if the house band or regular DJ would do a backyard wedding for a small wedding at a lower cost than a larger wedding Cut back on the hours that the contracted band or DJ would play to save some money there Wedding music is usually contracted for a minimum of four hours but it doesn t hurt to ask if you can negotiate for two or three hours instead and have all of the traditional dances and other events take place during that time frame After the band leaves you can set up your own stereo system for the remaining time when the rest of the guests would get up and dance Small Wedding FavorsSmall wedding ideas for favors lean a lot toward homemade wedding favors because you re doing everything on a smaller scale and if you give yourself enough time you can easily make 30 or 50 wedding favors by yourself or with the help of your bridesmaids Laminated bookmark wedding favors are popular for smaller weddings because they re as practical as the other small wedding ideas you used to plan out

you had to pick just two words two little words that would empower you to change your life what would they be Mine would be I can You ve probably heard various personal development experts life coaches or self appointed gurus tell you not to say I can t But why exactly are those two little words I can so important What do they add up to and how do they work I Am Responsible For My Life The first word is I For me this emphasizes who has to do the changing However much we might like to blame someone else for the bits of our life we don t like the truth is that we ve got full responsibility for our life conditions Unless you re in an very extreme situation like being held prisoner there s no reason why you can t wake up one morning and decide to completely overhaul your life You can Quit your job Start that small business you ve always dreamt about Learn to play a musical instrument Take the first step in healing a broken relationship Start eating more healthily Be more active Don t ever put your hopes for change on someone else This sort of thinking looks like It s up to my partner to get a good job then I ll be better off financially or If only my mother would cook healthier food I wouldn t be overweight No one else can change you If you re heavily in debt overspending addicted to shopping and you win the lottery will you really turn your life around Or will you rapidly end up back where you started You might want to read 8 lottery winners who lost their millions for some food for thought here However difficult your circumstances poor health family problems money troubles you can start the process of change by looking at your response to events Stephen Covey author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People emphasises that it isn t a negative event itself that s a problem it s your response to it He explains that Our most difficult experiences become the crucibles that forge our character and develop the internal powers the freedom to handle difficult circumstances in the future and to inspire others to do so as well I Have the Ability to Act It s not enough to just think I when you want to make a change in your life though Simply accepting that you re responsible for your life doesn t necessarily empower you to change in fact it can be a bit depressing when you accept that the bits of your life you don t like are your responsibility rather than someone else s fault So the second word that I consider crucial for change is the word can With the tools of motivation self discipline and guidance from those more expert than us it s possible for us to accomplish anything we really set our minds to and set our hearts on How often have you said I can t or words to that effect Have you ever attempted a goal that you were saying I can t about I certainly haven t Here are a few popular I can t statements I can t sing write paint act I m trapped in this job relationship town situation I don t have any choices It would be impossible to quit I ll never succeed I can t lose weight I always fail Think about one of your I can t statements What do you often tell yourself or others that you re incapable of doing I know that I often say that I can t sing Is your statement really true Is it actually impossible for you to do that or is it just that you don t want to face up to the fact that effort discomfort and perhaps emotional pain might be involved Is my I can t sing true No Singing is certainly not something I m naturally gifted at but I can sing and I know that if I took singing lessons I could learn to improve my singing You always have the choice of saying can do about your dreams instead of can t do Using I can Today I m sure there s something in your life that you d like to change but that you feel you ve not yet made progress on Perhaps it s something that other people have had an influence over such as your sense of self worth or your material circumstances Perhaps it s something which you ve been secretly convinced you can t change Keep that part of your life in your mind for a moment Recognize that whatever the influences from other people and circumstances you do have 100 responsibility for your actions and thoughts You do have the power to choose your response And now realise that you can change this whatever it is Even if you ve tried and failed in the past even if you re afraid it will take a lot of hard work even if you don t know all the steps to fully changing that aspect of yourself or your life just yet You can change If you re willing to share your thoughts and your own experience of how I can empowers change please take a moment to add a comment to this post About the author Ali writes about personal growth and development on her blog

Suck So Hard how qr codes work and why they suck so hard"",""body"":""QR codes are a technology that desperately wants our attention They appear everywhere from supermarket shelves and magazines to hiking trails and tombstones Never heard of a QR code You re looking at one right now Scan the image at the top of this article and it ll open a link to the mobile version of this article Very meta That s a pretty typical example of a QR code occasionally useful but often pointless Either way these plucky information sources are routinely ignored and usually reviled Here s where the next big thing in scannable coding went so horribly wrong QR Quick Response code is the trademark name for the two dimensional barcode system It was originally invented in 1994 by Denso Wave a Toyota subsidiary as a way to track vehicles as they were assembled and to scan components at high speeds While Denso Wave does hold the patent on the technology it has granted free licence on it going so far as to publish the spec online and allowing anyone to use it The conventional one dimensional barcodes used on virtually every consumer product are mechanically scanned That is they re read by physically bouncing a narrow beam of light onto the code which can be interpreted using the pattern of light reflected off the white gaps between the lines QR codes on the other hand can not only hold 100 times more data than 1D barcodes they can also be digitally scanned The block of smaller black and white squares is read by a smart phone s image sensor then interpreted by the system processor The three large squares act as alignment targets while the smaller square in the remaining corner acts to normalize the size and angle of the shot As you can see from the image on the left the blue strips near the alignment squares contain formatting information and the remaining yellow area is the actual data that s converted into binary code and checked for errors before being displayed The encoded data can be interpreted as one of four primary modes numeric alphanumeric byte binary and Kanji Other forms of data can also be displayed with the appropriate extensions As QR code technology evolved it began to contain more and more information The initial version was 21 x 27 pixels and held just 4 characters worth of data The most recent version is 177 pixels square and it holds 1852 characters enough for a few pages of information QR codes have long since expanded their usefulness beyond the automotive industry They re used today in everything from inventory tracking to shipping and logistics to online ticketing Fandango is a big fan Bands put them on fliers to link to their videos on YouTube or set reminders for upcoming shows Businesses use it to put Google Maps directions on a business card automatically load a web page or send a text email to the company helpline One enterprising wildlife refuge in Sanibel Florida has installed the codes on signs along hiking trails and programmed them with information about the local fauna So with all these new and interesting ways to use this burgeoning technology which coincidentally got a boost recently when it was announced that the iPhone 5 would not include the competing NFC system why aren t they more popular According to Comscore as of December 2011 only 20 percent of Americans 16 percent of Canadians and 12 percent of Spanish and UK smartphone owners actually use QR codes at all In part it s because advertisers have attached themselves to QR like it s a golden teat The rate of QR codes in magazine ads rose by five percent last year from 3 6 to 8 4 percent according to marketing firm Nellymoser You can find QR codes in stores billboards subway ads posters and magazines It s an effort to convey the appearance of being tech savvy Thaddeus Kromelis a strategist at WPP s WPPGY Blue State Digital told Business Insider Unfortunately most consumers aren t buying it Advertisers are looking at every way possible that they can connect with consumers said Forrester Research analyst Patti Freeman Evans Consumers aren t saying Oh I really want to be able to connect with companies and brands As such the primary use of QR codes last year was actually for product scanning either to recieve further information on a product or a coupon reward and was primarily done at home This is due largely to the inherent limitations that QR suffers from The system needs a steady hand to take the shot the proper QR app to interpret it and a data connection to load the webpage and content So when advertisers put QR codes on freeway billboards or on subway ads where there is little cell reception and expect users to then go through the trouble of installing an app just to be taken to the desktop version of the corporate website it s little wonder why nobody bothers with it Thick headed advertisers aren t the only drawbacks to QR codes though The codes can also be used to transmit malicious code in what s known as attagging Since anyone can create the codes it s easy to write a bit of malware put it in a QR code and slap that code over a legitimate tag Some sap scans the bad code and if his permissions are set too loosely the code could give itself access to everything from the camera to the contacts to the GPS data Or it could connect to an infection site loaded with browser exploits The phone an become part of a bot net or be used to send unauthorized texts hackers in Russia once used QR to commandeer phones to send 6 international SMS messages And of course there s the open source issue great for developers but not so terrific for the end users just trying to read the things There are multitudes of QR readers in every app store and all of them offer a slightly different user experience None of the big three iOS Android or WP7 offer a native app Plus there is no dominant brand of reader So users are stuck picking QR readers essentially at random hoping for the best All that hassle to hopefully look at a company s website or possibly have your security compromised It s a combination of factors that doesn t do much to spur confidence in the technology or enhance its adoption rate Wikipedia Forbes QR Me Statesman 2D Code Business Insider Yellow Image Swetake giz explains, qr codes, scanners, readers, malware, shopping, marketing, core, gizmodo qr codes are a

outside Bologna can one eat a proper rag these days Right in your kitchen if you follow my recipe To most people outside Italy Bolognese is lowly refectoire fare most often bought from the supermarket when not eaten straight off the can But in Bologna one of Italy s most prestigious cities for food rag bolognese is a legendary dish that is not only part but defines the city s identity Tackling such a legend would undoubtedly trigger a torrent of indignant emails from concerned Bolognese readers How dare you call this rag Bolognese they would say you are not from our beloved red city Well I have an ace up my chef blouse one that trumps them all Two legendary Bologna home chefs sisters Margherita and Valeria Simili have become the most respected authority on all things related to Bolognese pasta In their book Sfida al Matterello a manual in Italian to teach the principles of homemade pasta la sfoglia bolognese there is a whole chapter about making rag It is called His Majesty the Rag Here is how they do it Rag Bolognese2 tbsp butter2 tbsp oil 50gr 1 5 oz pancetta or parma ham or quality dried bacon 500gr 1lbs ground chuck beef or half beef and half pork shoulder 500gr 1lbs pured and skinned tomatoes passata 1 medium onion 1 medium carrot 1 celery stick 1 2 chicken livers 1 2 glass 1 4 cup dry white wine 2 glasses 1 cup full fat milk 2 glasses 1 cup chicken stock Salt pepper pinch of nutmeg In this article I prepare twice this quantity The Simili twins call for pancetta or Parma ham which you need to finely dice As you ll see later I used half prosciutto and half Valaisian petit lard a local flavorsome bacon Prepare the aromatic garniture Peel your carrot and onions and garlic clove if using Trim and wash a celery stick Cut the carrot lengthwise into thin slices then perpendicular to that cut to make long sticks and finally perpendicular to the two former cuts to make an orange sea of tiny carrot cubes Proceed with the celery stick Be thorough roughly cut cubes will show in the final product Finely dicing these vegetables is a way to show respect to the recipe the produce and your guests Reserve in a small bowl If you think chicken liver is best left to the dogs I won t blame you But in rag bolognese it is an essential ingredient The liver taste melts and disappears into the whole bringing a slight hit me back taste Nobody will be any the wiser unless they are from Bologna If you are doubtful please try with a little piece for Daddy and you ll see Wash carefully the livers to remove the slightest trace of the greenish bile then crush the livers under a flat knife and chop them All the ingredients prepared in their order of appearance bottom to top and left to right from the bottom left pancetta onions liver herbs carrots and celery meats butter milk wine tomato and oil On the stove my largest saucepan stick rust sensitive iron pan from the legendary Burgundy restaurant Greuse in Tournus Behind a smaller pot heats the chicken stock Another one will heat the milk Aspiring home chefs hear me take some time to read your recipes several times before you start You want it firmly commited to memory like a soldier who needs to field strip his gun in the heat of battle or a pilot who needs to pull a dozen controls in under 5 seconds in a gusty landing If you lay all your ingredients neatly and close to your stove you will not only increase your recipe s chance of success You will also make the process much more enjoyable with you celebrating the beauty of life and nature on the altar of your stove How would this liturgy look if you work from greasy papers and dirty bowls Place your widest frying pan on a very hot burner and add 2 tbsp oil with 2 tbsp butter Why a wide pan and why mix oil with butter We will soon saut the meat to develop its taste through browning Maillard reaction If we place too much meat in too small a pan the meat will render its juices and that will prevent any browning You ll be boiling your meat in its own juice If you have a small pan or a weak flame you ll need to brown the meat in several batches There is no point in doing this unless you can get your meat to turn brown so if you d rather ignore this recommendation which comes directly from the Simili twins you could ignore the meat sauting altogether whith a much less tasty end product of course We mix the butter with oil so as to increase the temperature beyond which the butter will burn Add the onions and fry until the onions are soft and their water has evaporated You do not need to wait until they are brown Next stop carrots and celery drop them into the onions and saut over high heat until they start to brown While this goes on prepare our next ingredients the pancetta On the picture I have Italian pancetta in the front and Swiss air dried petit lard in the back drop the bacon into the pan mix and saut to complete our aromatic garnish Push everything on the side My pan is oval shaped and designed to let the chef tonight I am the chef keep some ingredients hot while he cooks others on the part of the pan directly over the burner If you have a small pan don t worry there is hope Just remove the aromatic garnish onion carrots celery and bacon to a dish cover to keep warm and continue Add the liver and turn frequently as it coagulates Use a wooden paddle to break it into tiny pieces Place the part of the pan that is free directly on the burner and add part of the ground meat How much should you use Not more than what can cover the pan s bottom evenly You need to keep that pan hot If you put too much meat the pan s temperature will be absorbed by the cold meat and you won t manage to brown it If in doubt just use a lemon sized chunk of ground meat to start We will do this in

cookies"",""body"":""On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love gave to me Cornmeal Black Pepper Rosemary Butter Cookies After several weeks of nearly non stop high intensity cookie baking I present you with the final cookie of this year s Twelve Days of Christmas Cookies Starry Night bake a thon TA DA In the kick off post I set the stage for this completely new collection of cookies most of which break rather dramatically from the traditional holiday cookies of my childhood I really wanted to push my understanding of what makes a remarkable and thus memorable Christmas cookie I wanted to try new and exciting flavor and texture combinations I wanted to stretch myself as a baker As I say in the Twelve Days of Christmas Cookies Starry Night kick off post I wanted to throw tradition to the proverbial wind this holiday season However I did not change my basic tenets of what makes a cookie a HOLIDAY cookie Many cookies perhaps MOST cookies do not fill this bill in my estimation Here are the tenets I presented in the Twelve Days of Christmas Deck the Halls kick off post A holiday cookie must be Very very buttery Dry light tender and or crisp rather than chewy or moist An excellent keeper must store and or freeze for 3 weeks Small in size so you can serve and eat a variety Beautiful and festive Fun to make fun to eat fun to give All of this year s Christmas cookies meet these requirements And several of them are so incredible that I will not be able to wait until next December to bake and eat them again The cookie you are looking at is one of those cookies The first words out of MauiJim s mouth after eating this cookie and wiping the butter off his lips was You CANNOT share this recipe Then he proceeded to eat 6 more cookies claiming they were defective and thus not attractive enough for the photo shoot In truth he prefers the defective ones anyway You know the cookies that are a little too brown around the edges He says he wishes I would overbrown all of the cookies even though it mars their appearance Does he think those overbrowned edges on half of the cookies happen by carelessness Ha When I asked him why I shouldn t share the recipe he said WAY TOO GOOD This one goes in the vault Well I agree that these cookies are some of the best I ve ever created but it s Christmas and Christmas is about sharing your very best I want you to taste these amazing morsels so light crisp crunchy spicy and redolent with fresh rosemary and cornmeal And I can t unfortunately bake them for you So over loud protests from the love of my life I make you this little offering from my heart to yours I hope these special cookies add a little spicy sparkle to your holiday festivities TECHNIQUE NOTE To make these cookies extra easy I used my favorite no hassle shaping technique which does however require a 70 scoop available in kitchenware stores If you prefer to roll the dough out on a lightly floured pastry cloth using a cloth covered rolling pin and then cut them out with cookie cutters that is certainly an option Cornmeal Black Pepper Rosemary Butter Cookies This wonderful cookie is inspired by the cornmeal butter cookies made by Italian bakers in Italy and America alike I first sampled a cornmeal cookie many moons ago in a small Italian bakery in San Francisco As I recall the bakery featured half a dozen or more varieties of cornmeal cookies I was enthralled because the notion of adding cornmeal to cookie dough had never occurred to me This was before all the great Italian baking books that widened our horizons a few years later I loved the corn flavor and the open crunchy texture immediately Since then I have created many riffs on this traditional cookie but this is my new favorite 2\u00bd cups King Arthur unbleached all purpose flour 1 cup fine cornmeal\u00bd teaspoon fine sea salt 1\u00bd cups fresh unsalted butter at cool room temperature 3 cubes 1 cup sugar2 teaspoons almond extract2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper1 teaspoons fresh rosemary minced Finishingcoarsely ground black pepperclear sugar sprinkles I used Wilton s Pearlized Sprinkles In a large mixing bowl sift the flour add the cornmeal and salt Whisk the mixture well to evenly distribute Reserve In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment cream together the butter and sugar Add the almond extract pepper and rosemary and incorporate Add the flour mixture and mix very briefly on very slow speed just until a dough forms Using a 70 scoop 1 tablespoon with a release mechanism scoop balls of dough leveling each ball with the edges of the scoop Thus each ball will have one flat surface You can arrange the dough balls closely together on a baking sheet cover with plastic wrap and chill for as long as a couple of days or proceed immediately to baking Coat a baking sheet lightly with vegetable spray Arrange 12 cookie balls flat sides down 2 inches apart on the baking sheet Lay a sheet of waxed paper over the cookies and using a meat pounder or other heavy flat object gently flatten each cookie ball to a \u00bc inch thickness Coarsely grind black pepper over each cookie and then sprinkle each cookie with clear sprinkles Bake each sheet of cookies at 350 for about 15 minutes rotating the pan at the halfway point to ensure even browning Remove from the oven loosen each cookie with a thin spatula and let cool for 3 4 minutes on the pan Remove cookies from the cookie sheet and place on a wire rack and cool completely Store airtight in layers separated by wax paper rounds in a cookie tin in a cool dry place These cookies improve with age They keep for 3 4 weeks Cookies may also be frozen Makes about 6 dozen 2\u00bc inch diameter cookies There s More Check out the entire Twelve Days of Christmas Cookies Starry

wallet"",""title"":""Phone unlocking ban could could hit you in the wallet phone unlocking ban could could hit you in the wallet | pcworld"",""body"":""As of Saturday your options for owning an unlocked phone become far more limited You can ask your carrier to unlock it and good luck with that or you can pay a premium to manufacturers like Apple or Google for a new unlocked phone You just can t unlock your phone yourself at least not legally That decision was made not by voters the courts or even Congress It was made by one man 83 year old Congressional Librarian James Hadley Billington who is responsible for interpreting the meaning of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA Billington decided last October that unlocking your phone yourself is a violation of the Act which was originally written to prevent digital piracy Congressional Librarian James Hadley Billington When Billington made his decision he also granted a 90 day exemption period in which people could still buy phones that they could later unlock but only after asking their carrier to do it and getting no for an answer That period ends Saturday After that the question of whether or not the smartphone you buy is truly your own gets a little fuzzy The idea that a decision that will affect so many and involves so much money could rest on a single unelected person is bizarre at best and absurd at worst But indeed the law reads in Section 1201 of the DMCA Upon the recommendation of the Register of Copyrights the Librarian of Congress may designate certain classes of works as exempt from the prohibition against circumvention of technological measures that control access to copyrighted works What s it mean to me When you unlock your phone you change part of the firmware code in such a way that makes the phone able to connect to more than one wireless provider s network You can unlock your phone by plugging it into your computer and using any of the widely available unlocking software downloads The ban means that you won t be able to lawfully decouple your phone from one carrier and move to another carrier that uses the same cellular technology GSM CDMA etc unless your carrier agrees to send you an unlock code Imagine buying a car equipped with software that prevents you from taking certain roads and being legally barred from disabling the software The wireless carriers will unlock phones under certain circumstances but they don t like to For instance AT T will unlock your iPhone if you can prove you are a current or former AT T subscriber that your iPhone was designed for use on the AT T network and that you are in complete compliance with all contract obligations including any term commitment If you re still in contract they probably won t do it especially if its an iPhone so you won t be able to unlock your phone and connect it to a compatible network overseas With an unlocked phone you can visit another country buy a compatible SIM card at a store on the street and immediately get phone and web service Pre paid gets harder Many people now buy used iPhones and other premium smartphones then sign up for low cost no contract cell service from the likes of Virgin Mobile Straight Talk and T Mobile That s because in pre paid plans you have to either buy a new phone at full retail cost or buy a used one and bring your own device This approach gets you out of a costly long term relationship with a profit hungry carrier and likely saves you money every month on your phone bill It also saves you the financing charges that your carrier builds into your bill in exchange for subsidizing your phone up front But with the unlocking ban people can no longer legally quit their carrier usually after paying a penalty unlock their phone and sign up for a prepaid plan The ban may also make it much harder to find a good unlocked smartphone on the used market at a reasonable price Sure you can pay a premium to Apple or Google for an unlocked version of one of their new phones iPhone 5 Nexus but that makes joining a pre paid plan a costly experience at the outset And AT T will unlock your phone after your contract expires however by then you ve already paid the carrier the high monthly rates and phone finance charges for two years Big money There s big money at stake here The CTIA the association that represents the interests of the large cellular providers is first on the list to file a legal brief on the matter with the Library of Congress The 20 page document argues that the owner of the smartphone device is not necessarily the owner of the firmware running on the device and that altering the firmware is a violation of the copyright owned by the carrier The majority of the points argued by the CTIA attorneys in the document seem designed to disqualify the arguments of phone unlocking proponents based on legal technicalities Big carriers like AT T and Verizon make much more profit on post paid contract plans than they do on pre paid plans You need only look at the companies quarterly financial statements to see that The unlocking ban will simply help keep subscribers locked in post paid plans reducing churn And phone locking is the carriers main instrument for keeping people locking in two year post paid contracts The two year contract is designed so that the consumer is attracted by the offer of a subsidized handset at very low cost and then signs up for a two year service term to get it The carrier then receives a high monthly payment from the subscriber for 24 months that when totaled up far exceeds the real cost of the devices and services delivered during the contract period The real reason behind this ruling is that we re talking about a device that is tied to monthly recurring services says Dan Hays U S wireless services advisory leader at Price Waterhouse Coopers The desire on the part of consumers to unlock their phones really effects the challenge the mobile carriers face in continuing to pursue their subscription model And the CTIA says essentially that same thing in its legal filing One feature of the marketplace is the ability of carriers to subsidize handsets and to offer those handsets and their accompanying software to consumers at prices well below the prices that otherwise would need to be charged Those subsidies depend on ensuring that the handset will be used as contemplated with the carrier s service But not everybody agrees that that was the intended purpose of the DMCA The DMCA was never meant to enforce mobile phone business models or to preserve incompatible devices more generally and the Copyright Office should have said so and granted a broad exemption says Electronic Freedom Foundation digital rights analyst Rebecca Jeschke The truth is the decision to ban unlocking last October took place in a dark corner of Washington as Hays terms it Tech policy decisions handed down by the courts the FCC the FTC or Congress tend to get a lot of attention but who knew that a decision potentially so important to consumers would emerge from the office of the Congressional Librarian I d venture that the decision didn t pop up on the radars of many people in the tech industry and the media last October and is taking many by surprise now that the implications of the decision are about to become reality Hays says that when LTE phones become more common the issue of unlocking becomes even more important Today when you unlock an AT T GSM phone your only real option is to go to T Mobile which uses the same cellular technology But when all carriers have converted over to the new LTE networks the owner of an unlocked LTE phone has a choice of four major carriers and a number of regional ones Hays says the carriers may have worked hard to get an unlocking ban to protect themselves against widespread unlocking and massive churn in the LTE future phones bought after january 25 can no longer lawfully be decoupled from a carrier by the owner of the device. how did this decision come to rest with a single non-elected, non-technical, elderly librarian in washington? phone, keywords, drm phones bought after january 25

t like it and I thought most of the people who listened to it were weirdos But now that I m older and more mature I enjoy it And I no longer think people who like alternative music are weirdos I mean I like it how could they be weirdos So today I decided to take a look at the top 25 alternative songs of all time Now before we get started I have to come clean First you won t see Nirvana on here Why They make me sick and angry I m not sure why but if they come on the radio I get angry Second Stay by Lisa Loeb didn t make the list This angers me because I love her and love that song but my doofus coworkers told me it s not alternative Oh well I guess I ll leave the poor girl out By the way those glasses are hot 25 Black Hole Sun Soundgarden No idea what it means but it still makes me happy when it pops on the radio 24 Til I Hear it From You Gin Blossoms I think I liked this video because Liv Tyler was in it and the song grew on me enough that I loved it This was always on The Box 23 Only Happy When it Rains Garbage Another hot chick God these angry chicks were hot Plus she had red hair I m not a huge fan but the depression part of the song was great 22 Lightning Crashes Live Hard song to sing at Karaoke but what a beautiful tune I m surprised they never did anything of note after this album 21 Insane in the Membrane Cypress Hill I couldn t decide if this was just rap or alternative but I included it anyway They were a fantastic group I wonder what became of them 20 Warning Green Day I didn t like Green Day s early stuff but this and Minority were awesome Cover bands would play this a lot about 10 years ago and it always made for a fun time 19 Bittersweet Symphony Verve This is better as an instrumental but it s great with the words too The music sounds so happy but the guy in the video was a complete turd Say excuse me 18 Swallowed Bush This wasn t the kind of song that had longevity but I used my sister s car last summer to cart her kids around and it was on her satellite radio Let s just say that was an awesome ride to the water park 17 Jeremy Pearl Jam I wanted to go Elderly Woman Behind a Counter in a Small Town because that s by far the best Pearl Jam song but I didn t want to be ostracized so here you go Now go put your flannel on and shut up 16 1979 Smashing Pumpkins You wonder why I didn t like alternative fans They hung with freaks and ghouls Still you gotta admit this is catchy 15 Spiderwebs No Doubt Gwen Stefani sold out when she was singing about Hollaback Girls because she was phenomenal She s lucky she s still hot Plus my friend wrote a great parody to this song so it will always rank right up there with me 14 Epic Faith No More I m not down with hurting a fish like they did in the video but just thinking about this song makes me want to throw things in a fit of anger That s a sure sign of a good alternative hit 13 Runaway Train Soul Asylum Was this song really about runaway kids I hope not because I think happy memories of high school when I hear it 12 Snow Red Hot Chili Peppers I probably should have pointed this out but bands get no more than one song per list That s crucial because these guys could have made it a few times I think this song makes me the happiest when it comes on while I m driving so that s why it made the cut 11 Pride In the name of Love U2 Sure I was upset when they killed Martin Luther King and I don t like guys getting hurt on a barbed wire fence but as an Irish American I m not Irish don t call me Irish I feel pride when singing U2 songs 10 Everlong Foo Fighters I didn t want to like them but I had to This song is too perfect not to like In fact the Foo Fighters were great proving that in my world Nirvana would be great if it weren t for Kurt Cobain 9 Super Bon Bon Soul Coughing Too fat fat you must cut lean Another song that was played by at least one cover band in the Philadelphia area Steamroller Picnic It also was the theme song of Danny Doring in ECW What you don t watch wrestling 8 Sweetness Jimmy Eat World If you don t like to put this song on and jump around like you re House of Pain you aren t a person I d like to go on a road trip with 7 Good Better than Ezra This was a song I couldn t find on Youtube for years and I recently found it on there Needless to say my tough work days are a lot smoother 6 Dammit Blink 182 Remember when these guys were the it band I do because it was a fantastic time Sure we were also dealing with Limp Bizkit but Blink 182 was so great they made up for it This song is extremely short but it packs a lot of awesomeness into three minutes 5 High and Dry Radiohead I hung out with guys from Ireland and I think it was a rule they said how great Radiohead was every 10 minutes It was like traffic reports on the 2s This was really the only Radiohead song that I liked but I loved it It s still on Comcast s music on demand quite a bit 4 Summertime Sublime I m convinced that if Bradley Nowell never died Sublime would have been an all time great band They are still very good and they were only around for a few years I could probably put four of their songs in my top 25 but I went with Summertime because it was my favorite If you like another one I really can t argue 3 Come Out and Play Keep em Separated Offspring Not only was this Raven s entrance song it was also a song that got me fired up all the time It s also a great workout song It s a shame I don t do that 2 Zombie Cranberries I remember planning to go to their concert back in 1996 and the lead singer called out sick I think that s why I hate people who take sick days They had a great run and I d like to see them come back to relevance I could probably argue that When You re Gone was their best song but I think that s more of a love song 1 Don t Look Back in Anger Oasis It sucks when a good band breaks up but it s even worse when their brothers This song is great for me because it brings back great memories of fun times It s also a beautiful song fun to listen to and I think the greatest song of the 1990s The crazy chick Joe works with disavows any connection to this list thanks to the omission of Nirvana and having Oasis at No 1 Oasis Joe Seriously when it was cool to like alternative music, i resisted.

"",""body"":""Posted on Wednesday 19 November 2008 15 40 CST The more research they do the more evidence Ohio State University scientists find that specific elements of marijuana can be good for the aging brain by reducing inflammation there and possibly even stimulating the formation of new brain cells The research suggests that the development of a legal drug that contains certain properties similar to those in marijuana might help prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer s disease Though the exact cause of Alzheimer s remains unknown chronic inflammation in the brain is believed to contribute to memory impairment Gary WenkAny new drug s properties would resemble those of tetrahydrocannabinol or THC the main psychoactive substance in the cannabis plant but would not share its high producing effects THC joins nicotine alcohol and caffeine as agents that in moderation have shown some protection against inflammation in the brain that might translate to better memory late in life It s not that everything immoral is good for the brain It s just that there are some substances that millions of people for thousands of years have used in billions of doses and we re noticing there s a little signal above all the noise said Gary Wenk professor of psychology at Ohio State and principal investigator on the research Wenk s work has already shown that a THC like synthetic drug can improve memory in animals Now his team is trying to find out exactly how it works in the brain The most recent research on rats indicates that at least three receptors in the brain are activated by the synthetic drug which is similar to marijuana These receptors are proteins within the brain s endocannabinoid system which is involved in memory as well as physiological processes associated with appetite mood and pain response This research is also showing that receptors in this system can influence brain inflammation and the production of new neurons or brain cells When we re young we reproduce neurons and our memory works fine When we age the process slows down so we have a decrease in new cell formation in normal aging You need those cells to come back and help form new memories and we found that this THC like agent can influence creation of those cells said Yannick Marchalant a study coauthor and research assistant professor of psychology at Ohio State Could people smoke marijuana to prevent Alzheimer s disease if the disease is in their family We re not saying that but it might actually work What we are saying is it appears that a safe legal substance that mimics those important properties of marijuana can work on receptors in the brain to prevent memory impairments in aging So that s really hopeful Wenk said Marchalant described the research in a poster presentation Wednesday 11 19 at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in Washington D C Knowing exactly how any of these compounds work in the brain can make it easier for drug designers to target specific systems with agents that will offer the most effective anti aging benefits said Wenk who is also a professor of neuroscience and molecular virology immunology and medical genetics Could people smoke marijuana to prevent Alzheimer s disease if the disease is in their family We re not saying that but it might actually work What we are saying is it appears that a safe legal substance that mimics those important properties of marijuana can work on receptors in the brain to prevent memory impairments in aging So that s really hopeful Wenk said One thing is clear from the studies Once memory impairment is evident the treatment is not effective Reducing inflammation and preserving or generating neurons must occur before the memory loss is obvious Wenk said Marchalant led a study on old rats using the synthetic drug called WIN 55212 2 WIN which is not used in humans because of its high potency to induce psychoactive effects The researchers used a pump under the skin to give the rats a constant dose of WIN for three weeks a dose low enough to induce no psychoactive effects on the animals A control group of rats received no intervention In follow up memory tests in which rats were placed in a small swimming pool to determine how well they use visual cues to find a platform hidden under the surface of the water the treated rats did better than the control rats in learning and remembering how to find the hidden platform Old rats are not very good at that task They can learn but it takes them more time to find the platform When we gave them the drug it made them a little better at that task Marchalant said In some rats Marchalant combined the WIN with compounds that are known to block specific receptors which then offers hints at which receptors WIN is activating The results indicated the WIN lowered the rats brain inflammation in the hippocampus by acting on what is called the TRPV1 receptor The hippocampus is responsible for short term memory With the same intervention technique the researchers also determined that WIN acts on receptors known as CB1 and CB2 leading to the generation of new brain cells a process known as neurogenesis Those results led the scientists to speculate that the combination of lowered inflammation and neurogenesis is the reason the rats memory improved after treatment with WIN The researchers are continuing to study the endocannabinoid system s role in regulating inflammation and neuron development They are trying to zero in on the receptors that must be activated to produce the most benefits from any newly developed drug What they already know is THC alone isn t the answer The end goal is not to recommend the use of THC in humans to reduce Alzheimer s Marchalant said We need to find exactly which receptors are most crucial and ideally lead to the development of drugs that specifically activate those receptors We hope a compound can be found that can target both inflammation and neurogenesis which would be the most efficient way to produce the best effects The National Institutes of Health supported this work Coauthors on the presentation are Holly Brothers and Lauren Burgess both of Ohio

Mighty Atom Birmingham teenager Hannah Powell stands just 4ft 8ins tall and weighs only 97Ib Yet the 18 year old is bidding for Olympic gold next year as a weight lifter Miss Powell can lift almost twice her body weight and once lifted a man on her shoulders Mighty atom Hannah Powell weight lifter and Olympic contender works out at the gym She hopes to represent Britain at the 2012 Olympics The teenager from Rubery said During a night out a man asked me what I did for a living so I told him I was part of the British Weightlifting team He didn t believe me and said I wasn t strong enough So I asked him to get on my shoulders and I lifted him up He was around 70kg 154lbs which wasn t heavy for a back squat It s a good way to impress someone when they don t believe you Chalking up Despite standing just 4ft 8in in height and weighing a slight 97lb Miss Powell can lift almost double her body weight above her head Miss Powell got into the sport when she was just 11 years old She said My dad and uncle were weightlifters They both retired when I was quite young but I remember going to competitions and I was impressed by their trophies and leotards I wanted to be like them Trying weightlifting was an option at my school and there were other girls who had a go but they dropped out quite quickly I think a lot of my friends thought it was quite a strange thing to do especially as I m so tiny The original Mighty Atom was Polish weightlifter Joseph Greenstein He was born in 1893 and went on to become a world famous figure with feats of incredible strength including driving nails into a board with his bare hands and lifting a car up Despite being smaller than a postbox Miss Powell is a leading contender to claim one of two places available to British female weightlifters for London 2012 She can already lift a staggering 60kg 132lbs in the snatch and 80kg 176lbs in the clean and jerk And unlike many girls her age Miss Powell is actively trying to put on weight Tiny Despite her apparently masculine athletic discipline Miss Powell pictured right revels in her femininity and considers herself a normal teenage girl I have a small frame and my body obviously doesn t want to be any heavier than it is said the teenager who recently moved to Leeds to train at the National High Performance Centre I need to put on another 4kg so I have to eat more than I would normally to try to put on extra calories Whilst most girls my age are trying to cut down and be slim I m doing the opposite Other people drain fat off their foods but I end up adding butter and oil for the extra calories I train nine times a week plus two core sessions to strengthen my back and all the small muscles you don t think about when lifting The training is very technical and specific It s also very psychologically demanding Living the ordinary life in an extraordinary way Miss Powell centre pictured with her mother and her sister Bec at home in Rubery Her father and uncle were also both weight lifters But despite the tough and masculine image of her sport Miss Powell is very feminine She said People are usually surprised when I tell them what I do because they expect weightlifters to be big and butch and scary I wear make up and look feminine to show you don t have to look like a stereotypical weightlifter to be good at it I m still a normal teenage girl For me I love the competition the adrenaline training hard and the social side of the sport Competing internationally from a young age has given me a very different lifestyle To compete in my first Olympics at the age of just 19 and in my home country would be a once in a lifetime opportunity It really would be a dream come true eighteen-year-old hannah powell stands just 4ft 8in tall and weighs only 97lb, yet can lift almost

fresh basil"",""body"":""After my recent post about the huge dietary changes I ve made I m sure you re rather surprised to see this big plate of pasta Yes I ate some of it It was fantastic I guess this would be a perfect time to tell you a bit more about my approach to low carb eating Yes I have almost completely cut grains out of my diet for now and many other things as well I plan on eating this way for the rest of my life because I feel better than I ever have I haven t eaten pasta for about three months and for the most part I really haven t missed it much And that s because I ve never had any intention of completely restricting myself from a food that I love so much I will sometimes eat pasta but when I do it will be with intention It will be made with wonderful fresh ingredients and it will be shared with the ones I love Maybe I will only eat a few bites which is what I did last night maybe I will eat a bit more I just don t know yet But one thing I do know is that it will never be a last minute meal thrown together from a box consumed in front of the television Never Just like pasta I know that sometimes I will eat bread But it will be bread that s worth eating Not some strange spongy grocery store loaf filled with preservatives Not even the oven warmed or sometimes microwaved flavorless white stuff that comes to the restaurant table needing copious amounts of butter to give it flavor When I eat bread it will be from a favorite bakery in San Francisco when the smell of fresh baked loaves is too overwhelming to resist It might be wrapped around the best pulled pork I ve ever tasted from an amazing barbecue joint Or perhaps it will come from a friend s oven the first loaf of sourdough from a starter that I shared And maybe it will be from my own oven made with care for those I love It will be an occasional treat and it will be wonderful As you might have guessed the same applies to sweets I will someday add small amounts of honey maple syrup and other sugars the less refined the better to my diet I have no intention of going completely without sweets for the rest of my life But I m also aware of the damage that sugar has done to my body and now that I have abstained from it for so long I can actually feel what it does to me when I do eat some So yes occasionally I ll eat a bite or more of some fantastic looking dessert I ll let myself enjoy it and hopefully I ll stop before it makes me feel horrible But I ve already lost the serious cravings for really sweet things and I love how it s affected my taste buds Fruit and vegetables taste amazing now I look forward to a handful of fresh berries from the farmer s market with the same anticipation I used to feel standing in line for Pistacchio Gelato at my favorite Gelateria in Catania So now that you know a bit more about how I m eating let s talk about this pasta When the lovely Domenica Marchetti sent me a message on twitter a while back asking if I d make and share a recipe from her upcoming pasta cookbook I immediately said yes Although we haven t actually met in person Domenica is one of my favorite people to follow on twitter She s so warm and welcoming I feel like I ve already sat in her kitchen and shared a meal You ll feel the same after reading this book Everything about it is warm and welcoming the recipes the writing the photography It s beautiful When I first got the book I took it over to my Aunt Kathy s house I knew that if I made a big pasta dinner my family would have to be involved I left the book with my cousin and aunt so they could choose a recipe and when I got it back my book looked like this Just like me they couldn t choose just one recipe Unfortunately I lost track of time and wasn t able to pull together a big homemade pasta dinner for my family But it will definitely happen at some point in the future and this book will definitely play a part Since I didn t have time to make some pasta from scratch there are several wonderful recipe for homemade pasta in the book I chose to make Domenica s simple Tomato Cream Sauce to pair with some store bought Radiatori This gave me an excuse to go to one of my favorite local specialty stores Sam s Italian Deli and Market to buy canned San Marzano tomatoes for the sauce and to find the special pasta shape I was after Not only did Sam s carry the dried Radiatori pasta they also had a fresh version in their freezer I bought a bag of the fresh pasta which contained two servings Perfect since I wasn t cooking for a crowd after all Now for the sauce It starts with a combination of extra virgin olive oil and butter my two favorite ingredients When the oil and butter are heated add a mixture of chopped onion carrots and celery While the vegetables are sauteeing you ll have time to process the canned tomatoes in a food mill If you don t have a food mill you really should get one It s an inexpensive and wonderful tool The tomatoes will pass through the mill leaving behind the seeds cores and any skin that was left on the tomatoes What you ll end up with is a beautiful tomato puree After about 15 minutes the vegetables should be nice and soft Even though I was busy with the tomatoes I kept an eye on the vegetables stirring them occasionally and adjusting the heat to keep them from browning much Next add the tomato puree salt and pepper to the vegetables and bring it all up to a slow simmer At this point you ll partially cover the pot with a lid then let the sauce simmer for about 45 minutes Meanwhile your house will smell amazing After 45 minutes the sauce will have thickened and the vegetables will be very tender Take the pot off the heat and let it cool for a few minutes Next you can puree it with an immersion blender or in batches with a regular blender The final step is to stir in some cream If you d like to freeze part of the sauce remove that portion to a freezer container before adding the cream Once the cream is stirred in taste the sauce try not to swoon then add more salt and pepper if you d like While the ingredients are very simple this sauce is amazing I couldn t stop eating it by the spoonful And since I knew I wouldn t be eating much pasta I decided to try the sauce a different way My friend and I had just made Grilled Chicken Under a Brick and I couldn t resist trying a piece of the rosemary scented chicken smothered with the tomato cream sauce It was so delicious The thing to keep in mind is that Italian pasta sauces can be used in so many ways If you can t eat pasta there s no reason you shouldn t make a big pot of delicious tomato sauce For dinner simmer some big meatballs and vegetables in the sauce Pour it over sliced meatloaf chicken or Italian Sausage Toss it with zucchini ribbons or spaghetti squash The options are endless You can do the same thing with any sauce Be creative And if you are gluten free but eating other grains you can substitute your favorite gluten free pasta in any of the recipes in the book There are so many recipes in here that can work for anyone Yesterday on twitter my friend Tari and I were talking about tossing shaved asparagus with a rich cream sauce rather than eating asparagus on the side of Fettuccine Alfredo It sounded so good I almost dropped what I was doing to go buy some asparagus Making dietary changes is hard but rather than worrying about having to say no to your favorite foods try saying yes to new variations of your favorites I am so happy that Domenica asked me to join her Pasta Party to celebrate today s launch of her new book Making that sauce yesterday the first pasta sauce I ve made since going low carb really made me think about how to combine my love of Italian cooking with my new way of eating I may not be eating pasta very often but The Glorious Pasta of Italy will still inspire many terrific meals in my kitchen Domenica is hosting a pasta party on her blog today and several other fantastic bloggers have joined in and tried a recipe from the book Visit Domenica Cooks to see what the others have made You also might like to follow Domenica on Twitter or become a fan of Domenica Cooks on Facebook

Wildcats guessing where the ball is while another one of its players runs down the field to get in position to catch and score No 24 Isolation by the Redskins In this move the Washington Redskins create an isolation to give their players time and space to make the touchdown While the maneuver didn t work this particular time it was still obviously a little confusing and surprising for the other team No 23 Team Catches Opponent Off Guard In this trick play the team in white seems to catch the team in black off guard with their only half ready appearance on the field which gives one player the chance to run down the field while their quarterback can set up the pass without being worried about being tackled No 22 Keep Away In this classic baseball trick play a member of the team in the infield pretends to throw the ball back to the pitcher but actually keeps the ball When the runner thinks he s safe and begins to lean away from the base the infielder still with the ball runs

but continues to run down the field as if he has the ball and is going for the touchdown While the rest of the Arkansas team chases down the player they think has the ball the guy actually with the ball sets up a beautiful pass and throws it to another open teammate down the field allowing Alabama to score No 20 Pretend Trip Up and Loss of Ball In this quick little soccer play the player with the ball pretends to trip over the ball as he is dribbling but really kicks it between the legs of the two guys defending him setting himself up to take the shot and score on goal No 19 The Pop and Roll In this beautiful trick play Bethel College s quarterback pops the ball up and back behind himself to one of his receivers who is then able to keep himself upright just enough to score No 18 Cleveland Browns Secret Handoff In a series of confusing and lightning fast handoffs the Cleveland Browns are able to conceal the whereabouts of the ball and run the ball down the field and score No 17 The Fake Field Goal In this classic trick play LSU fakes a field goal and then runs in for the touchdown No 16 Fake Lacrosse Pass Off Similar to the classic hidden ball trick in baseball in this trick play a player pops the ball up as if he s passing it off to a teammate but in all actuality still has possession of the ball He s then able to score while everyone else is looking the other way Very sneaky No 15 Pretend Fumble and Recover The Patriots fake a fumble to distract their opponents and when one of their teammates has had a chance to run up the field and get open they recover it and pass for the score No 14 Ole Miss Secret Handoff Ole Miss pulls one of the greatest secret pass offs of all time in this play At the beginning of the play they hike the ball to one player who then immediately while still crouched down hands it off to another and then runs like he still has the ball The guy actually with the ball is then able to easily set up and execute a run earning Ole Miss a touchdown No 13 The Fake Throw In this trick play the pitcher pretends to throw to his teammate guarding the base and when everyone runs for the ball that wasn t actually thrown the pitcher runs after and tags out the player on that base No 12 Hidden Ball Lacrosse Trick This may be one of the greatest fake passing runs ever to be played in lacrosse In this play Boston creates a fake handoff tricking the goalie and allowing it to scoreThe play was so smooth and secretive that the other team didn t even seem to know that the other player didn t actually have the ball No 11 Is There Something Wrong with the Ball Is there something wrong with the ball coach Nope that s just a ploy this team used to trick its opponent into inaction in this play No 10 Cleveland Browns Secret Pass and Score Here is another amazing trick play from the Cleveland Browns In this one the Browns pass it off shortly and secretly several times to keep the other team guessing where the ball has gone While they re doing this Brian Robiskie runs down the field and gets open to catch the pass and score a touchdown No 9 UC Irvine Gets LSU with Hidden Ball Trick In this amazing trick play a player from UC Irvine knows he has no hope of getting the ball to third base before an LSU player touches it so he fakes a throw to the base After the fake he ran up and tagged the runner at second base it was so convincing and well done that the umpire called the LSU player out actually believing he was tagged out even though it was late No 8 Presbyterian College Trick Play Against Wake Forest This is what I would like to call a bounce pass and no it isn t a basketball trick It s actually a football trick In this play one player bounces the ball across the field to his teammate making the other team believe there has been an incomplete pass But the ball is actually recovered and while all of that distraction was going on another player got into the perfect position to catch the still live ball and score a touchdown No 7 Fake Catch and Throw In this foreign baseball game an outfielder pretends to catch what was nearly a home run and then proceeds to throw the ball back to the infield keeping the runners from advancing as far as they could have No 6 Left Fake This dodge is so effective and convincing that the player is able to shake off all defenders and run the ball for 98 yards down the field No 5 The Fake Pass Around This is the greatest trick lacrosse play ever In it one team pretends to pass the ball around and around but in all actuality only one player keeps the ball in his pocket Then when the other team is thoroughly confused about where the ball actually is they go for the score No 4 Fake Punt and Touchdown Here is an great example of how effective the fake punt can be In this clip the team running the play was actually able to score a touchdown off the fake No 3 Wrong Ball Play This is one hilarious and amazing trick play Here the maroon team fakes like the ball it has is not the game ball and then hands the ball off to the quarterback While the other team is confused about why the ball isn t the right one the quarterback runs down the field and scores No 2 Pretend Fall This is one tricky and potentially dangerous trick play One player approaching the ball pretends to fall while another player comes up from behind and then steals the ball from his fallen teammate creating confusion about who really has the ball on the field I wonder how many people have gotten kicked or hit in the head with the ball in this play No 1 The Walk Up This is by far the greatest trick play ever to have been used legally in a game Here the quarterback is gently handed the ball and begins to just walk forward while the rest of his team stays in starting position making it look like the play hasn t started yet which causes the other team not to move either Once the quarterback has cleared the defensive line he takes off running full sprint and scores with no one in his way to stop him rankings\/list, multiple sports, sfgate, seattlepi, latimes, philly lists, cool lists, chron lists, national lists and rankings, flagship he fakes to the left, passes to the

free "",""body"":""Morning citizen The grandly titled Julian Le Grand chairman of a ministerial advisory board called Health England has a humdinger of an idea for you smoking permits He proposes a ban on the sale of tobacco to anyone who can t flash a licence at the cashier Good news for smokers Le Grand reckons said licence should cost only 10 Bad news he wants to make the application process as deliberately complex as possible You d have to fill out a lengthy form attaching a photograph proof of age and a fee and send it all to a central Smoker s Permit processing centre and wait for your licence to come back by which point let s face it you would have probably died Oh and the licence expires after a year so you have to apply all over again each time it runs out Why leave it there Why not make it expire every 24 hours so you have to reapply each morning Or include a Sudoku on the application form Or force the tobacco companies to sell cigarettes inside complicated Japanese puzzle boxes Or change the name of the brands each week without publicising the change while simultaneously making it illegal for a shop to sell you anything you haven t asked for by name so you have to stand at the counter fishing for codewords for an hour Or here s a good one Julian make it a requirement for smokers to walk around with a broomhandle stuck through their sleeves running behind the neck so their arms are permanently splayed out like a scarecrow s To spark up under those conditions they d have to work together in pairs flailing around in the outdoor smoking area like something out of It s a Knockout His paper incidentally also proposes incentives for large companies to provide a daily exercise hour for staff Welcome to your future life having struggled into work suffering withdrawal pangs because today s smoking licence didn t arrive in the post you re forced to spend 60 minutes doing squat thrusts in the car park And each time you start crying a man in a helmet comes round to gently remind you that it s all for your own good Through a loudhailer If that sounds like a nightmare don t worry you can still wriggle out of the squat thrusts provided you re carrying a valid Laziness Licence whose application process involves climbing a ladder to reach the forms stored at the top of a 200ft crane ticking 900 boxes with a 7kg pencil and finally posting it into a motorised mailbox that persistently runs away from you at speeds of up to 25mph In other words you still have freedom of choice Provided you re carrying a valid Freedom of Choice Permit that is Getting your hands on a Freedom of Choice Permit is pretty straightforward The application form requires only your name and signature Admittedly you have to deliver it in person to the Freedom of Choice Licensing Agency which is open only between 4 15am and 4 18am and is based in an unmarked office in the Falklands but nevertheless thousands have already applied if the queues are anything to go by The current waiting time is a mere nine weeks although you d be advised to get there early and guard your place in line because there have been reports of disturbances Anyway once you ve got your Freedom of Choice Permit you re free to do as you please within reason provided you notify the Central Scrutiniser six days in advance of any unapproved activity quoting your 96 digit Freedom of Choice Permit code in full which isn t printed anywhere on the permit itself but is given to you once and only once whispered quickly into your ear at the desk in the Falklands by a man standing beneath a loudspeaker barking out other numbers at random The permit itself incidentally is shaped like a broomhandle and is designed to be threaded through your sleeves at all times If you couldn t be bothered with all that you will just have to do as you re told which isn t that bad to be honest There s a compulsory exercise hour or five and an approved list of foodstuffs but that s about it You will still have at least 10 minutes a day to do as you please although we ve just banned violent videogames which are bad for your head and there are one or two ideologies we d rather you didn t discuss with friends or on the internet which is why we re not issuing any Freedom of Speech Permits for the time being although if you d like to be notified when they re available simply book yourself into one of our underground holding pens and remain there until your name is called or not called or time itself comes to an end Whichever takes the longest Once upon a time in between

womansday.com"",""body"":""Nobody is naysaying the wonders of modern medicine what would we do without a medication like penicillin to treat infections But as it turns out everyday items have secret curing powers too Next time you don t want to fork over money to get a common wart removed consider using duct tape Already popped two aspirin but can t get rid of the headache A pencil could do the trick Below get medical explanations behind a few bizarre albeit brilliant MacGyver esque home remedies Duct Tape to Remove Warts In 2002 a group of doctors compared duct tape s effectiveness with liquid nitrogen in removing warts After two months of wearing duct tape on a daily basis and using a pumice stone about once a week to exfoliate the dead skin 85 percent of patients warts were gone whereas freezing only removed 60 percent The question is whether there is something in the chemical adhesive itself or if the occlusion suffocation causes the destruction of the wart says New York City based dermatologist Robin Blum MD The other thinking is that the duct tape causes irritation which stimulates our body s immune cells to attack the wart Photo Thinkstock Vapor Rub to Cure Nail Fungus While there are no studies to prove coating infected toenails with vapor rub once or twice a day is an effective treatment for nail fungus a basic Internet search results in a number of personal testaments to the medicinal ointment s fungus killing powers I ve heard many patients say that vapor rub does help but I m not exactly sure why Dr Blum admits While some argue it s the menthol in the balm that kills the fungus and others say it s the smothering effect of the thick gel if used consistently vapor rub has been shown to get rid of not just the fungus but the infected toenail too which will turn black and eventually fall off When the new nail grows in it should be fungus free Photo Thinkstock Oatmeal to Soothe Eczema This is absolutely true as oats have anti inflammatory properties Dr Blum says Whether it s used as a paste or poured into a bath most experts recommend choosing colloidal finely ground oatmeal and soaking the affected area for at least 15 minutes In addition to reducing inflammation oats are thought to have an antihistamine effect Dr Blum says By lowering levels of histamine which triggers inflammation as part of the immune system s recovery response she explains oats prevent or reduce the redness Photo Thinkstock Yogurt to Cure Bad Breath Bad breath comes from a number of places the two most common being the mouth and the stomach The neutralizing powers of yogurt and other probiotics treat the latter cause Yogurt shouldn t have any effect at all on the bacteria that live on the tongue because it s not there long enough says Robert Meltzer MD a New York City based gastroenterologist and attending physician at Lenox Hill Hospital However it likely has a neutralizing effect on the acid that resides anywhere between the mouth and the stomach including the back of the throat and the esophagus he explains I think almost any milk product or food that contains live cultures would have the same effect While yogurt can get rid of bad breath that results from gastrological conditions like acid reflux it won t have any real effect on bad breath that is the product of gum liver or lung disease says Ohio based dentist Matthew Messina DDS Photo Thinkstock A Spoonful of Sugar to Cure Hiccups In 1971 Edgar Engelman MD conducted a study to find out if a spoonful of sugar really is an effective cure for hiccups He assembled a group of 20 patients who had been experiencing intractable hiccups for more than six hours eight of whom had had them anywhere from a full day to six weeks Each of the test subjects was given one teaspoon of white granulated sugar to swallow dry and for 19 of the 20 hiccup patients the cure was immediate Andr\u00e9 Dubois MD a gastroenterologist in Bethesda Maryland noted in The Doctors Book of Home Remedies that the sugar is probably acting in the mouth to modify the nervous impulses that would otherwise tell the muscles in the diaphragm to contract spasmodically Photo iStockphoto Bite a Pencil to Cure a Headache While doctors aren t sure why we do it clenching our teeth is a common side effect of stress According to Fred Sheftell MD director of the New England Center for Headache in Stamford Connecticut when we clench up we strain the muscle that connects the jaw to the temples which can trigger a tension headache By placing a pencil between our teeth but not biting down we relax our jaw muscles which eradicates tension and reduces pain Just remember the remedy really only applies to tension headaches not migraines or headaches caused by sinus pressure etc Photo Thinkstock Olives for Motion Sickness According to the National Library of Medicine there are a number of symptoms that present themselves as a result of motion sickness including increased salivation which is the body s way of protecting the teeth from the high doses of acid accompanied by vomit Enter olives which contain tannins that when released in the mouth work to dry saliva first eliminating the symptom and then the body s instinct to follow suit However the treatment is only effective during the early stages of nausea when the salivation changes first appear Photo Thinkstock Gargle Salt Water for a Sore Throat When you were a kid and had a sore throat your mom likely made you gargle warm water with salt in it and she was definitely on to something According to Douglas Hoffman MD PhD author of the website The Medical Consumer s Advocate a sore throat is an inflammatory response of the infected tissues and the salt helps draw out the excess fluid to temporarily decrease swelling and the pain it causes Most remedies call for a ratio of 1 tablespoon salt to 8 ounces of water but it s always better to opt for more salt rather than less Just keep in mind that you are treating the symptoms not the illness As Dr Hoffman notes on his website The relief is very real but also tends to be short lived since the gargle has done nothing to remove the cause of the sore throat Photo Thinkstock health tips and home remedies that work at womansday.com alternative medicine, health tips health tips and home remedies that work at womansday.com"",""url"":""womansday

button down The Ambrose Burnside sideburns complete this masterful shot 6 Los Angeles Lakers Throwback Jersey The Minneapolis Lakers would only last 13 years 1947 1960 but they certainly cemented

released Apple made a big show of promoting its Facetime app and for good reason It s a valuable service that lets iPhone owners make a more personal connection to the people they care about while on the go Still for all of Facetime s blessings there s one glaring flaw with the app it only works with other iPhones While that s not necessarily a huge problem in and of itself it begins to exacerbate itself a bit when you hear news about Android becoming the largest and fastest growing smartphone operating system This means that as consumers increasingly move away from so called dumbphones it s grows less and less likely that you ll be able to video chat with your new friend on your phone Luckily there are a huge number of cross platform smartphone apps that allow you to work your way around this problem Here s a list of our INSERT NUMBER favourite apps available on both iOS as well as Android Tango A free video chat service that functions much like Apple s ballyhooed Facetime However aside from allowing iPhone owners to talk to Android users it also doesn t restrict you to using WiFi for calls While video chat on 3g can admittedly be rather spotty at times it still manage to serve its purpose fantastically while not confining you to any specific platform WhatsApp If there s one thing that all mobile phone users can agree on it s that text messaging rates are inordinately high Combat the problem by grabbing the WhatsApp messenger from either the App Store or Android Market WhatsApp allows those who own the application to send text messages to each other without the usual SMS charges And with additional availability for both BlackBerry as well as Nokia s Symbian you ll find yourself with a much larger ecosystem of users Facebook Probably goes without saying but having a Facebook account is almost a necessity in this day and age Though the Android Facebook application initially lagged behind its iPhone counterpart in terms of functionality it s made a dramatic comeback and both are now fully featured Tweetdeck It s usually the case that the official version of apps is the best but Tweetdeck is one of the few exceptions to this rule Tweetdeck s columnar layout makes sorting through direct messages mentions and of course the users you follow a simple and intuitive process Furthermore with the ability to add additional custom columns Tweetdeck is almost essential for those who use more than one Twitter account Spotify Pandora This of course is heavily dependent on where you happen to live but both streaming music services allow you to listen to music on the go without needing to have all your mp3s on your phone Spotify in particular allows you to connect to Facebook and share your favourite tracks and playlists with your friends making for a more interactive listening experience Google Goggles A fairly handy do it all type app Google Goggles core functionality revolves around allowing you to take a picture of a product with your phone s camera which is then scanned and turned into a link that allows you to see the specific name of the product However recent updates have included other functionality such as allowing one to scan QR codes as well as solve Sudoku puzzles in case you decided you needed that for whatever reason Dropbox So you ve got your computer at home a netbook for travel a tablet to use on the go as well as your smartphone with you at all times Chances are this means you ve also got a lot of files scattered about that are a pain to sync Dropbox allows you to conveniently access your data all in one place and access your files from any device Kindle Let s face it there are going to be times when you re waiting in queue that you simply get tired of playing Angry Birds for the 100th time For those instances it s always nice to keep some reading material handy The Kindle app for both Android and iOS gives you access to Amazon s library of new and popular releases as well as thousands of free books Its syncing ability also allows you to save your page your bookmarks and your notes across other devices including of course the actual Kindle itself Shazam So you re walking through your favourite store and you hear a catchy song but have no idea what the name of it is No problem simply launch Shazam hold your phone up and it ll do all the work After a short period in which the app analyzes the song being played it ll give you both the artist and title allowing you to find it much more easily than you would ve been able to otherwise Bump Probably unnecessary but it doesn t take away from how awesome the app is Bump allows users to exchange pictures or contact information like phone numbers and email addresses simply by opening the app and bumping fists with one another So Apple s App Store may admittedly be a bit more refined at the moment but it s clear that there are a good number of quality apps available for Android phones as well Part of the mass appeal of smartphones is the ability to augment your device s core functionality with a number of programs that allow for functionality your phone wouldn t have otherwise So no matter what device you ve got chances are you ll be set so long as you know where to look when the iphone 4 was released, apple made a big show of promoting its facetime app and for good reason. it's a valuable service that lets

"",""body"":""Dependable that s what cast iron is It will last for centuries if properly cared for and it has a natural non stick surface that s eco friendly When I was a bride my Granny gave me two of her cast iron skillets A tiny 6 inch one for making cornbread for two and a 12 inch skillet for everything else She told me all I d ever need to be a good cook was those two skillets a sauce pan a stock pot and a casserole dish And in a pinch she said I didn t really even need the casserole Cast iron has been around for hundreds of years Before fancy teflon cookware was even a notion cast iron was the standard for good cooks everywhere Dependable that s what cast iron is It will last for centuries if properly cared for and it has a natural non stick surface that s eco friendly You can bake a pan of cornbread scramble some eggs make your favorite vegetarian black bean chili or sear a perfect steak Cast iron cookware is the definition of all purpose If you don t already have a cast iron skillet here are a few reasons to go to your nearest resale shop or garage sale and begin looking for one You won t regret it Top 5 Reasons Why Cast Iron Cookware Is So Green Cast iron is naturally non stick Properly seasoned see below nothing will stick to it Cast iron eliminates the need for the costly toxic chemicals used to create the non stick surfaces in modern cookware Eco easy clean up All cast iron cookware requires for clean up is hot water and a stiff brush so you avoid any harmful chemicals in detergent or solvents Cast iron can take the heat It can withstand much hotter temperatures and will distribute the heat more evenly than traditional cookware And since it holds heat well you can use less energy to cook Plus it s perfect for outdoor cooking Just remember that cast iron gets hot so use an oven mitt when handling a hot pan It s a great upcycling opportunity Don t ever worry about buying a cast iron skillet or other cast iron cooking vessel like a dutch oven from a resale shop or garage sale Even if it looks rusty and dirty it can be cleaned and re seasoned and continue on cooking forever It s good for you Cast iron cookware leaches small amounts of iron into food so you get a little extra iron each time you use it Almost anyone especially women in their child bearing years will benefit from this How To Properly Season Cast Iron CookwareFirst wash your cast iron cookware This is the only time you will need soap to clean it but you want to be sure you remove any dust or dirt If you have a brand new cast iron piece you will need to do this to remove the wax coating that is on it to keep it from rusting until it s seasoned Coat your piece in some type of oil Cast iron has a porous surface The seasoning process will fill and smooth the surface to make it non stick Some type of oil is used to facilitate this process I use Crisco vegetable shortening Traditionalists would use lard You can use plain old cooking oil too but you will get better results with Crisco You want to coat the entire cooking surface with the shortening Don t glob it on but every nook and cranny should have a nice medium layer of shortening Use about as much as you would use to coat a cake pan for baking Bake it in the oven Next you just pre heat your oven to 350 degrees and put your cast iron pan in for an hour or so After heating turn off the oven and let it cool completely while still in the oven Then it s ready to go Heating the cookware creates the oxidation that prevents rust and makes the surface non stick Some cast iron users advocate heating the pan slightly before applying the Crisco to ensure that the pan is completely dry and to open the pores of the pan before seasoning Not a bad idea but remember cast iron gets HOT Use oven mitts Newly seasoned cast iron will take on a dark brown coating After long use it will become glossy black The non stick properties of the pan will increase with time and use so use your cast iron often Remember seasoning is a process Even though cast iron can be used immediately after the first seasoning your cookware will get better and better over time How do I re season a used cast iron piece If you buy a cast iron piece second hand the process is still basically the same to re season it with one exception First wash it in hot soapy water as above Then I put it in my oven on the highest setting or on the self cleaning setting if you have one and let it bake for a few hours without any oil or shortening This will remove any rust and the old seasoning Let it cool then follow the steps above to re season Caring For Your Cast Iron CookwareAfter each use clean your piece with very hot water and scrub with a stiff brush to remove any particles left behind Don t use soap it will remove the seasoning After you scrub the pan give it a light coating with some Crisco or vegetable oil and store it in the oven Why Because the oven will have less moisture this will help keep your cast iron from ever rusting Plus each time you use your oven is an opportunity to further season your pan Even if you take your cast iron pan out while using your oven give it a light coating of shortening before putting it back in the warm oven Especially if it s a new piece this will help develop the seasoning further I have treasured those skillets Granny gave me and I ve added to my collection over the years A dutch oven in 1989 and a griddle just last year At a garage sale in Los Angeles about 15 years ago I bought a giant deep skillet that turned out to be called a Texas skillet An omen I

Celebrities such as Brad Pitt are notorious for completely transforming themselves within a few months to get ready for a certain film role Over the years Brad Pitt has slimmed bulked and cut for various roles Lets take a look at some of those movies over the last 15 years that have seen Pitt take on the challenge of shaping up In Brad Pitts early years photos show just how slim he was In 1991s Thelma Louise Pitt had a visibly much leaner look this was actually his more natural build Many would class Pitts body type as an Ectomorph which is someone that is typically classed as a Hard Gainer is flat chested lean lightly muscled someone who takes longer than the average person to gain muscle and generally of thin build Being in his twenties at this time diet and hard training was not that important to him he naturally had a fast metabolism and only did some occasional weight training preparing for Thelma and Louise it was ab training where he spent much more attention Being naturally lean certainly helped Pitt with getting his abs in really good condition for the film It was not until appearing in Fight Club nine years later in 1999 that people really took attention to Pitts physique Hed clearly trained and dieted hard in preparation for this one After Fight Club was released Pitt became the envy of many men His tight body was coveted and many people sought a workout that would produce similar results However contrary to what most people thought Pitt was actually at his lightest weighing in at only 150 155 pounds with body fat around 5 6 It has been well documented that Pitt had an extremely regimented routine for the months before filming began His workout was characterized by beating one muscle group up each day then giving it the rest of the week to recover similar to the kind of routine a professional bodybuilder would do Finally at the end of the week he finished off with a good cardio workout This put his body into fat burning mode which served to shed any extra padding that covered his muscles giving him that chiselled and ripped look Here are the exercises that made up his Fight Club workout 3 sets of each exercise taking approximately 60 seconds of rest between each set Pitt used a weight challenging enough that he could successfully complete 15 reps no less with the exception of pushups and pullups but be fatigued on the last rep Proper form was maintained throughout Monday Chest 25 pushups Nautilus chest press Nautilus incline press Pec deck machine chest fly Tuesday Back 5 pullups Seated rows Lat pulldowns T bar

Sunday Rest Nutrition Diet Brad s diet is the most important aspect when it comes to getting him in shape for a role Don t just think he trains hard in the gym his diet accounts for much of his success in achieving the physique produces For his Fight Club role Pitt took on a very strict and consistent diet eating six small meals a day which included a Whey Protein Powder and on occasion some protein bars no other supplements were used by Pitt however much of his nutrition came from whole foods high in protein like Chicken Turkey Fish Lean Meat Eggs and Cottage Cheese Carbohydrates were very clean and included Wholewheats and Grains Green Vegetables Oats and Rice Cakes which were then tapered off in his last two meals of the day Breakfast would be 6 eggs 6 whites 7 yellow and 75g of oatmeal with raisins Occasionally Pitt would replace the eggs with a Protein Shake if his schedule was tight Midmorning snack Tinned Tuna in Wholewheat Pitta Breads Lunch 2 x Chicken Breasts 75 100g

would argue that he actually looks even leaner in Snatch but not according to Pitt Staying at the 5 6 he had maintained for Fight Club would not have been healthy He cut to get the Fight Club Look that was required for such a film After the film he relaxed his cardio and strict diet to ease himself into a more normal and manageable physique So what you see in Snatch are his heavy bulking efforts combined with a less strict diet Pitt did not follow such a regimented program for Snatch infact he barely trained at all Five years later Pitt was given an even more challenging body transformation he needed to add 10 15 pounds of solid muscle for the movie Troy 2004 In order for Pitt to get ready for the role he dropped cigarettes and sharply cut back on beer and chips although he did allow himself the occasional treat McFlurry shakes from McDonald s though it was more for a little taste of home you know a little Americana Pitt stated in a 2005 interview Brad used a low carb high protein diet during the training for his role Physically Pitt prepared for the role with a year of intense training The first three months were daunting and not fun at all His days included two hours in the gym two additional hours of sword work and four high protein low carb meals As a result he gained about 10 15 pounds of brawn As you can see in the photos Pitt was in pretty impressive shape in Troy good muscle size and great proportion He was also not looking so top heavy as he had in previous films meaning his legs looked too skinny compared to his upper body In Troy hed visibly put some good mass on his thighs which gave him a good overall appearance and a more proportionate physique Weight training wise Pitt bought down the rep ranges compared to when he trained for Fight Club he also lifted heavier this enabled him to add some muscle bulk So in summary Pitt exemplifies that through hard work and dedication someone who may not be genetically gifted at building muscle mass can actually overcome these barriers Pitt would probably be the first to admit that he doesnt have the perfect body but most would argue that he does represent what most guys would love to look

marilyn vance interview  elle.com"",""body"":""It was the first film I ever wanted to own It was the love story that taught me everything I needed to know about never settling for anything less than a man who will untie your robe and slide you lower back first across a piano and smile lovingly as he watches you cry at your first opera And it was the dialogue classic lines like If I forget to tell you later I had a really nice time tonight and She rescues him right back that would lace my conversations and pad my Dear John letters for as of today 20 years On March 23 1990 the romcom classic Pretty Woman premiered clinching Richard Gere his third straight decade as one of Hollywood s sexiest and most versatile leading men and established Julia Roberts as so much more than a shock of gorgeous hair and an ear to ear smile The two of them Gere then 40 and Roberts a very new 22 who only took the role after several actresses Molly Ringwald and Daryl Hannah among them passed weren t a likely couple which in the opening scenes of the film keep you from ever guessing their characters workaholic businessman Edward Lewis and wig wearing working girl Vivian Ward would go on to serve as one of the most sustaining cinematic love stories in modern film history While it s usually the case that we attribute a film s success to its most visible contributors with Pretty Woman which until just before its release was to be called 3 000 referring to the amount Edward would pay Vivian for her six days of companionship there is a star beyond the actors beyond director Garry Marshall and even beyond that hippie stringbean at the end who shouts What s your dream Everybody s got a dream That person is veteran costume designer Marilyn Vance The woman who took Vivian from thigh high patent boots to a floor sweeping off the shoulder red gown Vance a Brooklyn native who now resides in Los Angeles not only styled the clothing you see in Pretty Woman she also designed selected all fabrics and took Haute Couture care of every outfit s every single stitch Aside from a pair of Chanel heels and the tie Vivian wears with nothing else to greet Edward with when he returns to the hotel after work Vance and her team created every last one of the iconic fashion moments in the Oscar nominated film Vance who last year received the Career Achievement award by the Costume Designers Guild for her 30 years in the business began her career when she suited Phoebe Cates in the red Norma Kamali two piece in Fast Times at Ridgmont High gained momentum when she literally forced Molly Ringwald into the pink patchwork prom dress in Pretty in Pink and reached fever pitch when she slipped Patrick Swayze into nothing but tight sweatpants and high tops in the Tai Chi scene in your author s second favorite film Road House Quite simply if it was a movie born in the 80s and 90s and one you love more today than you did back then Vance was likely the hands on deck designer In an interview I ve been waiting to conduct since I unwrapped my very first VHS copy of Pretty Woman on that Christmas morning back in 1990 Vance graciously fielded my many many questions and discusses among other things how incredibly patient Gere and Roberts were during their marathon of fittings how one of the most famous red dresses in film history almost wasn t red and what might ve happened to the polo match hat had she not been able to find enough brown and white polka dot fabric Julia was so young when you worked with her on Pretty Woman What was she like back then She was just so new back then 21 22 years old I think She was so terrific to work with and so patient I can t even tell you how patient she was fittings for hours color tests for hours and she never complained Not once Fittings for hours Is that unusual These days it is Unless you re working on a period piece or something that requires a lot of original costuming because the theme of the film is very specific in a certain way most of the time now it s all styling For Pretty Woman and all the films I did back in the 80s and 90s it wasn t styling it was actual costuming I designed and had made almost everything you see on screen My team and I did all of that You designed the red opera dress Yes And did you know that it almost wasn t red The studio really wanted black but I knew it needed to be red Before the decision was made we ended up having to create three different dresses We took every color lit it and shot her Poor Julia had to sit for so many color test shots for that one dress Finally I was able to find the right shade and convince everyone to go my direction Pretty Woman wouldn t have been Pretty Woman had that dress been black what were they thinking laughing I knew what I was doing And what s so funny about that dress is that every year since its release Western Costumes the manufacturer that cut the pattern for the dress gets multiple requests from men who send in their significant other s measurements to have it recreated They want to recreate the entire scenario That is incredible I knew women loved that film but to have men get involved What s odd is that these men are almost always from Texas Who knows why in celebration of the 20th anniversary of pretty woman, we go behind-the-scenes with the film\u2019s costume designer, marilyn vance. read the interview on elle.com. pretty

nothing you can do about it now You are frantic because it is your turn to host it This time the responsibilities have landed upon you You are starting to cry Hey Stop that crying There is no crying in cooking You have to suck it up Step up to the plate It is your turn to shine Sure the task sounds daunting Scary almost Cooking an entire meal for a gathering and hosting it can be a bit too much for any one person In reality you might go crazy Have no fear I m here to help Who am I you might be asking Well I m your cooking conscious of course You won t go crazy as long as I m around So the tears have stopped but now you have begun to sweat Wipe that sweat off your face Do not fret Keep your chin up Hold it up high Higher Higher There you go You can do this Be confident Have a stiff upper lip You are a master in the kitchen Oh you are not Well let us pretend you are You are the master and the kitchen is your domain Say it with me I am the master and the kitchen is my domain I do not think you meant it that time Once more with feeling I am the master and the kitchen is my domain There you go It s easy Keep all the other dinner parties you have attended in the back of your mind and take note that they have all been deliciously entertaining What is more they have all been easy flawless even The other hosts and hostesses have blown it out of the water They have knocked it out of the park They have put together spectacular summer dinner parties Parties that guests are still talking about That is what we need This is what you will do We have to throw a party that people will talk about for weeks and weeks on end Your party will come and go and your guests won t be able to stop mentioning it You too will shine The Joneses have nothing on you The fire has been lit within you The spark ignited Your confidence higher An evil smirk sprawls across your face You contemplate what to serve as you start to go through all the recipes in your repertoire No those tired and stale recipes will not do here You need a new one A fresh recipe For a spilt second you lose yourself in the idea of ice sculptures and chocolate fountains Wanting so badly to impress To impress your family To impress your friends To impress your neighbors To impress those know it all Joneses Thoughts of live bands jugglers tents chandeliers and ceiling acrobats enter your mind You get lost in your own wild ideas and schemes Caviar Sundae bar Seafood buffet Silent auction For a few minutes you lose consciousness Your eyes glaze over and you enter a dream like state where fancy grandeur and expensive float all around you Suddenly you awaken You come to You open your eyes and realize that you are standing on top of your kitchen counter with your arms stretched out laughing uncontrollably What has gotten into you I have created a monster I walk up and slap you I slap you hard across the face Your look registers a state of shock A state of disbelief when you realize where exactly it is your are standing and that the slap had to be done I m sorry I just slapped you but it had to be done Now listen up You do not need fancy buffets and extravagant entertainment to throw a memorable dinner party Sure people will be mesmerized with such things because they are nice but in reality they will be just as impressed with simple and delicious food You do not need to slave away for hours in the kitchen worrying about making individual meals or a wide variety of appetizers Dinner parties should be stress free They should be fun You are there to enjoy the party as well You deserve it just as much as your guests do if not more What you have to do is make one easy dish One that is packed with flavor and is set to impress Often times people get overly ambitious and think they need to make something with exotic ingredients They base a recipe s excellence on the amount of ingredients listed However the simple reality is that less is more All you need are a few simple and well thought out ingredients to create a show stopping meal For instance take normal everyday chicken breasts some good hearty crimini mushrooms onions garlic sour cream a few spices and herbs here and there and while you are at it a pound of healthy whole wheat egg noodles Why you got yourself a meal fit for a king or queen I m an equal opportunist conscious what can I say Wipe that look of confusion off of your face What can you make with said ingredients Well thank you for asking my young grasshopper you can make Chicken Stroganoff Chicken what now Well Chicken Stroganoff of course Make this classic dish reinvented for the dinner party and the ooohs and ahhhs will just come rolling in The Joneses will hate you for it You ll be a star People will want to be you I can see that look of intrigue in your eyes How do you make Chicken Stroganoff you ask Well let me show you how Just put your trust in your ol cooking conscious here and I will teach you how to make such a dish We begin with our simple yet incredibly delicious ingredients We first have to start by preparing the chicken I know I know what does that mean What are we preparing it for Is it going out What should it wear We re preparing it for cooking silly Chickens don t wear clothes You ll need 3 chicken breasts Tip You can also use dark meat if you d like Or a mixture of both white and dark for a tasty combination 2 chicken breasts are probably more than enough for 4 people I however don t like it when you re eating a dish of some sort and you need a magnifying glass to find the meat So I fixed the problem by adding another chicken breast Feel free to add more if you are having more people over Cut each chicken breast into thin slices I use a plastic cutting board to cut the raw chicken I have one that is solely designated to cut raw protein Never cut raw chicken or meat on a wooden cutting board It can hold bacteria if you do It can cause cross contamination and create diseases People could get seriously sick Did I scare you enough to get a plastic cutting only for raw meat and chicken Then cut each strip into chunks Chicken chunks Slivers Chicken slivers Nuggets Chicken Nuggets Cut all the chicken like this and throw it into a bowl Tip You can also make this the classic way with beef Just swap out the chicken for top sirloin roast instead It s time to season the chicken Here s what you ll need Garlic Powder Onion Powder Paprika Crushed Red Pepper Salt Pepper Thyme Give it a toss Eh just use your hands Why not Just make sure you wash your mittens really well Along with the cutting board and knife you used Sanitation is key Don t cross contaminate anything This has been a PSA for the prevention of salmonella Toss the chicken and spices until evenly coated We re now going to cook this here chicken Start by heating a large pot I like using a heavy duty dutch oven over medium high heat Drizzle in a bit of olive oil You ll most definitely have to cook the chicken in batches Do not overcrowd the pot because if you do the chicken wont really brown and caramelize rather it will just steam and boil Developing no color or flavor No one wants that So lesson of the day do not crowd You should brown Hey that rhymes Cook the chicken about 3 5 minutes per side flipping once to develop a nice caramelization on the chicken nuggets The chicken slivers The chicken chunks You are not really cooking the chicken all the way through Just browning it It will continue to cook later on So once the chicken is golden brown use a slotted spoon to scoop up and transfer to a plate while you continue cooking the rest Continue in batches until all the chicken is browned At some point during the process you might need to add more oil if it needs some Allow the chicken to rest on a plate while we proceed to the next steps of the meal When all the chicken is browned let s cut and cook some veggies Start with an onion Cut off the ends slice in half and remove the skin Then give it a dice Let s also chop the garlic while we re at it You ll need about three cloves of garlic Try to use fresh garlic whenever possible The flavor is just unbeatable I would shy away from using the already chopped garlic in a jar It isn t as fresh as it could be Tip If you have an aversion to chopping garlic or just do not like to do it use a microplane or handheld grater to grate the garlic instead In the last post I grated it In this post I decided to chop it What can I say I m fickle So to the pot where you cooked the chicken add a bit more oil if there was not enough left over And don t worry about the browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pot that is nothing but flavor Later on when we start to cook the veggies it ll lift up from the pan and create a great tasting sauce Trust me So toss in the chopped onion and garlic Stir and allow to cook until translucent and caramelized While the onions and garlic cook this is your opportunity to prepare the mushrooms I like to use crimini mushrooms for this dish I feel like they have more flavor than the ordinary plain white button variety But that s just me Feel free to use whichever kind of mushroom you like best There s a myth out there in the foodie world that if you wash mushrooms under running water they toughen up on you Now I do not know if this is true as I ve never tried it out of fear So to not take any chances I always just wipe down my mushrooms with damp paper towels I do not want tough mushrooms Do you Some things are not worth risking Mushrooms are those things After you have wiped them down remove the stems You can save the stems for later I know what you are thinking What on Earth will I use these stems for conscious Well do not fret my friend Tip You can freeze them and use them in a vegetable stock later on Or throw them into soups to make them more flavorful Anyhow I digress Let s focus our attention back to the mushrooms Slice them Thinly Okay throw them into the pot Give them a toss to mix in with the onions and garlic If there is one thing you take away from my blog well honestly I m hoping you learn a lot of things not just one but if there is one lesson that sticks to you it should be to season as you go Season every layer Seasoning is key So once you add the mushrooms season with a bit of salt and pepper A pinch and a dash or a dash and a pinch Stir once more and cook until golden brown Now let s make a roux What is a roux you ask Well thank you for asking A roux is a fancy schmancy cooking term for a thickening agent It s basically just flour and fat usually butter mixed together That s it Nothing fancy about it huh Anyhow the roux will thicken our sauce So make a well in the center of the pot In the center drop in the butter Let s take a moment to just admire the beautiful picture above It isn t because I took the picture No it s what the picture shows Mushrooms garlic onions and butter Is there anything better Serve this on a plate for me right now and I m golden I could just stop the post here and say we re finished We could eat this together and be happy But I suppose we have to finish the entire dish I guess Add in the flour Stir that together and allow to cook for about a minute You want to cook out that raw flour flavor say that five times fast It should start to smell nutty Next stream in the chicken stock If you re making Beef Stroganoff you can use beef stock instead While you re at it dump in the worchestire sauce as well Give it one giant colossal stir Okay maybe a couple stirs Allow the sauce to bubble boil and thicken I just got a vision of us gathered around a cauldron Wearing pointed hats Laughing maniacally Why is that Remember the browned chicken How could you forget those precious nuggets slivers and chunks Throw it into the hot tub This is where the chicken will continue to cook Stir it into the sauce Allow to simmer for about 5 10 minutes on low This will let the chicken cook and get tender In the meantime you can cook the egg noodles I m using a whole wheat egg noodle I mean because why not Might as well be healthy Cook the noodles until slightly tender or Al Dente if you want to be fancy So the noodles are Al Dente Look at us we re being fancy Truthfully I used whole wheat noodles because the next ingredient isn t as healthy so I m offsetting We do not have to feel guilty about the sour cream because we used whole wheat noodles That works right Next step is the sour cream what I tell ya And do not use some of that low fat or fat free sour cream stuff here There s no place for those things in this recipe or any for that matter I always say if I m going to use something like sour or heavy cream I m going to use the good stuff I ll go all the way Anyhow sour cream is a classic stroganoff ingredient It gives it that creamy look and taste to it And of course like many dishes there are a wide variety of recipes and variations out there The popular variation uses sour cream so I m using sour cream Remember that important tip season every layer Add a tad bit more salt and pepper Now before I get e mails about how I add a ton of salt to everything I m only adding a tiny bit here and there It s not like I m throwing in a tablespoon of salt each time It s a pinch Season to taste It s important to taste as you go along That s how you make sure the seasoning is correct If it tastes good then you re good So stir once again Allow to come to a small boil A simmer It s ready Let s serve this dish up You can do this in one of two ways 1 You can toss in the noodles into the pot and stir it all together Or 2 You can do what I do to impress your family or guests and arrange the noodles on platter Top with the chicken stroganoff There All done Looks good right It s missing something though A little color You eat with your eyeballs first Or something like that That up there is parsley But I m sure you knew this already That up there is flat leaf parsley I like it better than the curly kind It has more flavor in my opinion And I m your cooking conscious so you take my opinion Give it a rough chop Sprinkle it over the chicken stroganoff Okay now we re done BAM Sorry Emeril dinner is served Make this for dinner one night Your family will love it Having a party Make this for the party your guests will love it Live by yourself Make this for yourself you will love it I like to make this for a quick weekday dinner I ll serve it with a simple green salad or saut\u00e9ed green beans I also like to put an extra dollop of sour cream when I serve it What It tastes good that way It s a very simple meal Many people think that stroganoff is rather complicated to make That it takes hours to cook But that isn t the case It s super simple right You can make this no sweat Okay I ll stop with the images now Have I tempted you enough to make it Come on You know you want to Print This Chicken Stroganoff You can easily make this dish the classic way with beef Just swap out the chicken for top sirloin roast and the chicken stock for beef stock Yield Serves 6 8 Ingredients 3 chicken breasts trimmed 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 2 teaspoon paprika 1 2 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves 1 tablespoon worchestire sauce salt and pepper to taste 1 large onion chopped 3 garlic cloves chopped 2 packages fresh

chicken in batches being careful not to overcrowd the pan Brown the chicken about 2 5 minutes on each side Do not worry about cooking it all the way this step is just to develop color and flavor Continue saut\u00e9ing the chicken in batches until it is all browned Transferring the finished pieces onto a plate to rest Throw in the remaining tablespoon of oil and add the chopped onions and garlic to the pot Stir occasionally and allow to caramelize until the onions are soft and translucent Add the sliced mushrooms Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and stir coating the mushrooms completely with the oil onions and garlic Cook for about 5 minutes or until the mushrooms are browned Make a well in the center of the pot Add the butter and flour mixing together to make a roux Cook

the sauce to thicken and bubble slightly Throw in the chicken along with the juices and continue to cook on a simmer for about 5 10 minutes In the meantime follow the instructions on the egg noodle package to cook Pasta should be slightly tender or al dente Drain and let sit for a minute while you finish the sauce To the sauce and chicken add the sour cream and season once more with a pinch of salt and pepper Stir together and bring to a simmer Toss in the egg noodles and sprinkle with the chopped parsley for garnish Or you can arrange the cooked pasta on a serving platter and just spoon over the chicken stroganoff on top Garnish with a dollop of sour cream and chopped parsley Serve right away Stroganoff can be made in advance and stored in the fridge When ready to serve just reheat on the stove and cook the noodles then simply toss together Enjoy 19 August 2012 by Jonathan Categories Main Dishes Pasta Tags Chicken Chicken Stroganoff Dinner Easy Main Dishes Mushrooms Pasta Sauce

Advertising Cooperative the group that reps U S franchisees decided to sue Kentucky Fried Chicken KFC to get control of the advertising strategy This came in the wake of poor sales second quarter revenue at American KFCs those open for a year or more decreased 7 percent 1 Many franchisees have voiced disapproval over a couple KFC decisions Last year the company introduced grilled chicken and the slogan Unthink KFC Recently however sales of grilled chicken have sunk according to Larry Starkey owner of seven KFC franchises Are people beginning to Unthink KFC and grilled chicken Carcinogen This month a medical non profit s lawsuit over a carcinogen found in grilled chicken is set to continue after a California appeals court reversed a ruling 2 Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine PCRM tested grilled chicken samples from several chain restaurants including ones from McDonald s The organization said in court filings that the tests found the presence of a carcinogenic chemical called PhIP which is produced through the cooking process used by the fast food chains So the committee filed suit saying that the restaurants are required to post warnings under a California law which stipulates that businesses cannot expose individuals to chemicals known to cause cancer without first giving clear and reasonable warning The restaurants countered that the state rule was preempted because such signage would contradict federal efforts to guarantee that food was cooked sufficiently to prevent the spread of food borne illness The restaurants all know that the grilled chicken has a cancer causing agent in them said Neal Barnard president of the physicians group They ought to share with you what they know McDonald s referred comment to the California Restaurant Association where spokesman Daniel Conway lambasted the charges of misleading consumers He said the levels of PhIP in grilled chicken didn t merit concern and that a proliferation of signs like the ones demanded in the suit would do nothing more than cause consumers to ignore warnings of greater consequence My biggest message is that grilled chicken is safe he said Bottom line But what do the scientists say This year about 562 340 Americans are expected to die of cancer more than 1 500 people a day 3 While thirty percent of cancers are caused by tobacco dietary factors also play a significant role in cancer risk At least one third of annual cancer deaths in the U S are due to dietary factors A recent review on diet and cancer estimates that up to 80 percent of cancers of the large bowel breast and prostate are due to dietary factors 4 Estimated Percentages of Cancer Due to Selected Factors 5 Diet 35 to 60 Tobacco 30 Air and Water Pollution 5 Alcohol 3 Radiation 3 Medications 2 Numerous research studies have shown that cancer is much more common in populations consuming diets rich in fatty foods particularly meat and much less common in countries eating diets rich in grains vegetables and fruits 6 While fruits and vegetables contain a variety of vitamins minerals antioxidants and phytochemicals to protect the body by contrast recent research shows that animal products contain potentially carcinogenic compounds which may contribute to increased cancer risk 7 Meat Meat naturally contains amino acids and a protein called creatine that is found in muscle tissue When meat is grilled this combination of amino acids and creatine form heterocyclic amines HCAs A major compound of HCAs is amino imidazo pyridines PhIP which is the compound found most abundantly in cooked meats 8 Meat need not be well done or charred to contain HCAs Testing has found HCAs in grilled chicken cooked for just three minutes on each side HCAs can pose a cancer risk even when consumed in small amounts No safe level of PhIP linked to several forms of cancer has been identified it appears to increase cancer risk even at very low levels 9 An analysis by Cancer Project Organization has revealed that grilled chicken has more than 10 times the amount of HCAs than grilled beef nearly all the HCAs detected were in the form of PhIP The table below lists the five foods containing the highest levels of HCAs The Five Worst Foods to Grill Food Item HCAs nanograms per 100 grams Chicken breast skinless boneless grilled well done 14 000 nanograms 100 grams5 Steak grilled well done 810 nanograms 100 grams6 Pork barbecued 470 nanograms 100 grams7 Salmon grilled with skin 166 nanograms 100 grams8 Hamburger grilled well done 130 nanograms 100 grams6 100 gram portion equals about 3 5 ounces grilled Vegetarian Foods The Cancer Project Organization recommends plant based foods which do not contain HCAs Because creatine is found in muscle tissue not in plant based foods vegetarian foods do not produce detectable levels of HCAs when they are grilled These healthful grilling options include soy based veggie burgers vegetable kebabs barbecued tofu and portabella mushroom steaks These foods are also low in fat and cholesterol They may be low in fat and cholesterol but are they safe to eat Arsenic To fight the boll weevil in the 1950s U S cotton growers spread a pesticide that contained arsenic An effective killer the pesticide was also used against the gypsy moth Yet it had an unexpected side effect the soil of the fields and forests where it was applied remains laced with low levels of arsenic 10 Arsenic can t be broken down to harmless by products It stays in the soil unless rain or irrigation water washes it into the groundwater or a plant like rice which is now farmed on the old cotton fields takes it up into its stems leaves and grains Some plants can draw arsenic and other metals into their leaves and stems at doses that would easily kill other plants Scientists call these plants hyperaccumulators Unfortunately some food plants particularly rice are also very good at drawing in arsenic from the soil In July 2008 scientists in Japan and the United Kingdom reported why rice mistakes arsenic for silicon which is essential 11 Silicon stiffens the rice stems and leaves keeping the plants from falling over or lodging when their seed heads get heavy It helps the rice plant grow stronger husks and also protects the seed against fungus Poultry Today poultry producers also use arsenic against parasites They have sometimes supplemented chicken feed with roxarsone a compound containing arsenic to control parasites and promote weight gain Most of this arsenic is excreted by the birds and then becomes mixed in with sawdust and other litter materials used in poultry houses Farmers then typically use the litter as a nutrient rich and free fertilizer for amending their crop soils 12 The use of organoarsenicals in the poultry industry primarily roxarsone has increased as the industry has grown Concentrations of roxarsone normally added to feed are relatively low between 45 and 90 g t 1 However in areas of intensive poultry production such as the Delmarva Delaware Maryland Virginia Peninsula the application of roxarsone derived arsenic to agricultural soils can be quite acute 13 In 2000 approximately 620 000 000 broilers were raised on the Peninsula resulting in an estimated annual load of arsenic to Delmarva soils of 26 000 kg from land application of poultry litter 14 Arsenic and Health Arsenic is a known human carcinogen Chronic exposure to arsenic contaminated water is an important public health hazard around the world including the United States with millions exposed to drinking water with levels that far exceed World Health Organisation WHO guidelines 15 Prenatal arsenic exposure in human populations has been associated with pronounced long term health consequences The evidence comes from studies of 32 mothers and their children in a province of Thailand that experienced heavy arsenic contamination from tin mining Similar levels of arsenic are also found in many other regions including the US Southwest 16 Leona D Samson Director of MIT s Center for Environmental Health Sciences CEHS and the American Cancer Society Professor in the Departments of Biological Engineering and Biology at MIT said We were looking to see whether we could have figured out that these babies were exposed in utero just by using the gene expression screening on the stored blood samples Samson says The answer was a resounding yes The gene expression changes the group found in the exposed children are mostly associated with inflammation which can lead to increased cancer risk Recognizing the damaging effects of the arsenic exposure the government has provided alternative water sources to the affected villages Arsenic contamination of the Ron Pibul drinking water is roughly the same as that known to be present in many of the western United States suggesting that prenatal arsenic exposure may also be a problem there 17 It may be a good idea to warn pregnant women of the dangers of eating grilled chicken accompanied by vegetables grown in Maryland or anywhere else that uses arsenic as fertilizer Bottom line Tags Arsenic Cancer carcinogen dietary factors and cancer fast food fast food and diet

skipping from plane to plane but wanted to travel using the least amount of energy as possible he wanted to give back to the planet He first visualised achieving his dream with the help of an amphibious microlight during the 1980 s Around 2003 Domjam s ideas soon began whizzing together as both he and the company Horus Networks achieved to become the world s first to propose solar powered web hosting and e mails to their clients an idea so unique yet thoroughly intriguing A year after Domjam conjured up the idea of achieving the first around the world voyage in a solar boat This idea seemed strange to others at the time as the concept had not taken off or become fashionable in the early 2000 s This meant hard work passion and commitment to develop sponsors and schools to become involved in the project Providing a team of motivated enthusiasts who followed his ideas and goals soon started the propelling of his adventure In 2008 all financing for the boat was secured the yacht costing 17 5 million In total over 100 people are currently working for PlanetSolar to achieve such a stimulating and renewable journey through the oceans The Around the Globe Expedition Setting off from Monaco the Turanor PlanetSolar will pioneer the use of sustainable energy technology on water This is a rarity to current date nothing has been achieved by motility that works so effectively Equipped on board is the very latest cutting edge technology available on the market 825 solar panels some compact in the extendable wings of the craft sit waiting to absorb the sun s light that can generate up to 93 5 kilowatts a perfect demonstration that high performance solar mobility can be achieved Built within 14 months the biggest ever solar boat is striking silent clean and green The four man crew will cross the Atlantic Ocean Panama Canal Pacific Ocean Indian finalizing with the Suez Canal before setting back home by the Mediterranean The stopovers along the journey will be organised in large port cities of Miami Hong Kong Singapore and Cancun for examples So imagine the looks on tourists and natives faces when the large yacht sails up gleaming from the shatters of bounced sun rays hitting the crafts decking During their stops PlanetSolar will use the platform as promotional spots for renewable energies paying particular attention to solar I must admit a very interesting and excitable way to promote better uses of energy sources But what happens if the sun disappears for a while PlanetSolar have already got it covered Lithium ion batteries in both floats power up the ship during the hours of the night and for up to three sunless days A computer controls the flow of energy to the batteries and motors that rotates the yachts six foot propeller Very clever aye And just to be sure PlanetSolar aim to remain approximately 30 latitudinal degrees of the equator fully maximising its exposure to the suns glorious rays of power to the craft The extortionate name of the boat Turanor was derived from the Lord of the Rings saga by the famous J R R Tolkien and when translated means the power of the sun and victory a very clever and well fitting metaphor to describe such a triumphing educational inspiring eco friendly creation So let s send our wishes to the team abroad the Turanor and a huge thank you to the rest of the team behind the face of PlanetSolar I find nothing more inspirational then wanting to develop break through technology that does not deliver money or a reputation but in fact uses science to achieve and promote sustainability By raising the awareness of the importance of renewable energy whilst demonstrating that economy and ecology can and should work together only gives us readers hope for a cleaner future

when rough wakeups were breathed life by several clicks of the remote An eager switch to SportsCenter would offer juicy rumors magical highlights and intelligent debate Nowadays our screens are flooded with Stephen A Smith and Skip Bayless over analyzing the Tebow Sanchez friendship and scrutinizing LeBron for smiling the wrong way And there s the occasional Eli vs Peyton chatter thrown in for good measure But media coverage as a whole isn t the only overreaction in sports Plenty of passionate athletes angry coaches and boisterous commentators continue to add unnecessary although sometimes preferable flavor to situations that don t call for it Excessive celebrations historic rants beer tossing brawls We ve seen it all Let s recap the 50 juiciest overreactions in sports Slowly drying paint has never been so exciting 50 Boston Fumes over Wes Welker s Butterfingers Sticky fingered Wes Welker dropped perhaps the most crucial Patriots pass of Super Bowl XLVI and many New York fans were eager to applaud him But Pawngo returned the favor dropping 1 000 butterfingers in Boston to thank the sure handed receiver Hilariously potent Should ve been one million of them to detail the chances of such an occurrence So you re saying there s a chance 49 Jim Schwartz Is Shaked by Jim Harbaugh s Hand Two young teams collide in the heat of the moment tension filled electricity still permeating throughout Ford Field Then comes beastly Jim Harbaugh with the handshake of the century and an accidental post shake shove In mere seconds Lions coach Jim Schwartz clings to respect like Jeff Van Gundy hung on to Alonzo Mourning s leg in 1998 barely 48 Gus Johnson s Historic Spasm Most of us remember the image of Adam Morrison crying after his Gonzaga team squandered a 17 point lead to UCLA during the 2006 NCAA tournament What we may have forgotten was the barbaric call from the legendary Gus Johnson The man s vocals are as rhythmic as Miles Davis jazzy tune and as climactic as Morgan Freeman s narration and he always manages to propel any type of moment into the record books Breathtaking 47 Tiger Woods Provocative Side Golf is meant to be a peaceful game one of grace and patience Tiger Woods gives the microphones a different angle The question remains who s side did his third person perspective take during arguments with Elin Nordegren 46 Serena Williams Racket Rage The dominant Serena Williams couldn t contain herself in the heated 2011 Finals but she did speak with elegance I truly despise you It almost provokes a smile Williams would later in the video tell reporters she didn t remember what was said Believable but frightening 45 Dennis Green Motivational Eruption Then 1 5 the Dennis Green led Cards would eventually succumb to failure and finish 5 11 And their head coach would be fired following the season with one year left on his contract But the former Iowa halfback would leave his carving on the Arizona franchise Squandering a 23 3 lead in the fourth quarter to the Bears would give any coach chills For Green it was more like adrenaline 44 Rivaldo Dabbles in Acting We get the art of flopping but if the ball hits you in the knee perhaps you should grab your knee and not your face Just a thought Brazil s Rivaldo was once a great footballer then came that ball to the knee 43 Jim Mora Questions the Postseason Introducing life as a Mets fan it s a painful experience After his Colts fell to 4 6 in 2001 a furious Jim Mora gave arguably the greatest gridiron rant of all time Overreacting to a reporter s curiosity is like blaming water for being wet Useless Historic footage 42 Jim Everett Gets Revenge Losing all his confidence in a sack filled 30 3 defeat to the 49ers in the 1989 NFC Championship Game was tough enough for quarterback Jim Everett But having media blowhard Jim Rome refer to him as Chris like female tennis player Chris Evert made things far more frustrating for Everett When his agents were called regarding an ESPN interview Everett jumped on the opportunity It would get ugly when he realized Rome was the featured host Table tossing was a creative route 41 John Mcenroe Gets Too Serious Such a boyish tantrum locked in the annals of history forever Perhaps the rant that cemented John McEnroe s colorful legacy Opponent Tom Gullikson could only watch in awe at 81 Wimbledon 40 Ryan Leaf Rejects Friendship Calm down bro it s not their fault you re a failure under center The poor media always gets the backlash A couple more hugs could ve helped former second overall bust Ryan Leaf 39 John Calipari Goes Top 10 on SportsCenter Let s take a breather sit the next few plays out perhaps John Calipari took the John Cheney route and enthusiastically spit his true feelings at John Buccigross Not the biggest fan of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania it seems but thanks for the laugh Oh and don t turn down the Donny Iris 38 Mike Singletary Prefers 10 For all the losses Mike Singletary still built a potent unit in San Francisco His talented pack could never find a winning formula until Jim Harbaugh arrived but Singletary planted the seed for prosperity Vernon Davis had to be inspired Yet Singletary s claim for 10 players may have been outrageous albeit hard nosed Chill time for the Hall of Fame backer 37 A Heated Disrespect Potent stuff huge legs nicely said Skip Cool calm and collected Dirk Nowitzki never deserves this type of mockery this type of vintage 16 year old stuff We believed in his runny nose But this is where ESPN First Take steps in and takes unimportant issues and makes them headline worthy news Let s take it down a notch or three 36 Jack Nicholson s Broadcasting Prowess Before he nearly had an aneurysm Jack Nicholson showed off his white boy hops Brilliant raw footage The Lakers No 1 fan hasn t shined this bright since The Shining Zing 35 Gus Johnson Strike s Again Gus Johnson once again ignites our eardrums with his eloquent announcing yet this time we re left wondering If Titans tailback Chris Johnson is one of the few with get away from the cops speed those must be some fast policemen On the other hand Gus can make the growing of grass sound exciting 34 Rob Gronkowski Takes to Twitter Rob Gronkowski s Kodak moment with porn star Bibi Jones conquered the web faster than fast actin tinactin but that s not what has us intrigued The pic became fodder for media members worldwide though nothing actually happened between the two smiley celebrities I wish something happened but nothing did said Jones Gronk s biggest drop yet 33 Living the Dream Step aside streaking interrupted goals are the new fad Fans yearning for the spotlight as usual 32 Joe Buck Is Disgusted with Randy Moss It didn t seem like such a such a heinously disgusting act when it first appeared on screen considering he didn t actually moon the crowd but after further review yeah Joe Buck is still epically unnecessary This is just the wide receiver style nothing personal Buck 31 Clemson Fandom at Its Finest Looks like our Friday nights as Knicks fans A heartbreaking loss to Georgia Tech in 09 gave this Clemson fan the coverage of his life The commentators enjoyed a lengthy this is epic and he s tweeting filled ramble 30 A Nassau Nightmare For linesmen gracing the Nassau Coliseum ice on February 11 2011 Penguins vs Islanders became dinner and a show After Pittsburgh s Maxime Talbot leveled New York s Blake Comeau in concussion resulting fashion nine days earlier the Islanders were set for vengeance 17 fights to be precise Sucker punches flooded corner scraps and angry goalies 346 penalty minutes doesn t properly detail the bloody mayhem 29 Derek Anderson Gets Chippy That s fine That s fine Lois Lois Mum Mum According to quarterback Derek Anderson cameras were off in their translation of the exchange He wasn t smiling merely taking stuff seriously 28 Hank Williams Jr Makes the Biggest Political Mistake Ever This interview slowly becomes a rake on a chalkboard Painful and numbing Hank Williams Jr s lack of eloquence goes far beyond words Either get him a muzzle or an education 27 Rex Ryan Fires Up Snack Time For most of us eating is this exciting But without specifying the snack Rex Ryan s ferocious request can only inspire so much Less snacks more cowbell 26 Ray Hudson s Legacy You had us at Bonkers Former midfielder Ray Hudson shows us that enthusiasm can cloud any lack of understanding In other words we have little idea as to what he s saying half the time but his tone forces us to nod in agreement He is the best the pitch has to offer 25 Oakland Jumps on Carson Palmer At 4 2 the future looked bright for the fiery Raiders until solid yet unspectacular quarterback Jason Campbell went down with a broken collarbone suffered in Week 6 against the Browns With a playoff berth somewhat in sight Oakland decided to mortgage the near future on coach potato Carson Palmer who seemed ready to embrace retirement as a real option after the Bengals refused to trade him But a 2012 first round pick and a conditional 2013 first round pick was steep for a 31 year old tree who hadn t touched the gridiron in weeks First sign of things to come an 8 8 record in 2011 24 Mike Tyson Gets Lyrical After knocking out Peter Hurricane McNeely in a mere 89 seconds blossoming heavyweight Mike Tyson took to the mic for some ferocious vocals Lennox Lewis would soon learn that Iron Mike s style was actually impetuous and his defense somewhat impregnable but that he didn t actually eat children A rivalry sparked 23 Brian Cushing s Helmet Chuck A little toying and poking from Browns lineman Shawn Lauvao forced linebacker Brian Cushing into breast mode Rip the helmet off step up to the plate and slam heads Oh wait 22 Bobby Knight Gets Tired of Sitting Purdue vs Indiana February 23 1985 five minutes remaining tensions fuming Foul call on Indiana s Daryl Thomas following a loose ball chase forces legendary Bobby Knight into one of his masterful tantrums Chair tossing classy 21 Introducing Comedian Stevie Johnson Let s be real if Stevie Johnson is getting fined for mocking Plaxico Burress then every player who Tebows should also be subject to a 10 000 ticket Just a thought Our favorite celebration was when Johnson pretended to drop a game winning touchdown against the Steelers Wait 20 Izzy Alcantara Ruins Martial Arts What starts out with a solid form karate kick becomes a disgrace full of flailing and missing Former outfielder Izzy Alcantara left his carving on the game of baseball when he ended catcher Jeremy Salazar s day early An underwhelming six game suspension followed 19 The Man the 40 Year Old Mike Gundy Now that we ve cleared up the official age of manhood we can dissect Mike Gundy s colorful lecture Defending his quarterback from an Oklahoman article was admirable but the humorous approach was historic According to the San Francisco Chronicle Gundy has toned down since 18 Owen Schmitt s His Own Worst Enemy Now that he s in Oakland Owen Schmitt s insanity can finally be appreciated The Black Hole will instantly love him True grit from the heady fullback 17 George Brett Gets Pinned for Pine Tar With the Royals trailing the Yanks 4 3 in the top of the ninth inning of their historic 1983 bout Kansas City great George Brett hit a two run home run to put his squad ahead But manager Billy Martin had other ideas His request to have Brett s bat examined more closely for pine tar paid off as he was called out Yankees win Of course the Royals also took the protest route American League president Lee MacPhail eventually ruled that the pine tar did not impact the home run On August 18 the last four outs of the ninth inning were replayed with Kansas City securing a 5 4 victory A mind boggling finish 16 Bill Gramatica s Notorious Celebration Karma strikes again After hitting a 43 yard field goal against the Giants with less than eight minutes remaining in the first quarter of a regular season game a jubilant Bill Gramatica couldn t contain his excitement He would lead the 5 7 Cards to greatness Torn ACL Out for the season Arizona finishes 7 9 15 Woody Hayes K O One of the greatest coaching careers in history came to a screeching halt in 1978 when frustrated Ohio State legend Woody Hayes knocked himself out of college football With the Buckeyes losing by two points in the waning moments of the 78 Gator Bowl and in field goal range freshman quarterback Art Schlichter was picked off by noseguard Charlie Bauman in heartbreaking fashion Hayes was not pleased and after Bauman was tackled on the Ohio State sideline gave his young opponent several solid swipes before being restrained by his own players He was fired the next day He never coached again 14 Gus Frerotte Uses His Head This just in concrete hurts Since his head butting Pro Bowl 1997 season Gus Frerotte has found himself battling for parts of the pine The eventual journeyman looks back on the excessive celebration that ruined him 13 Pete Rose Banned from the Hall We re not condoning his bets but if steroid associated players like Roger Clemens and Barry Bonds are going to have a shot when they possibly cheated the game Pete Rose deserves the first nod Substance abuse improves performance gambling on one s own team does nothing to enhance or worsen play His name was Charlie Hustle for a reason now let the 4 256 hit man in 12 Terry Tate Trucks Teammates Terry Tate has been warming our hearts since first introducing himself during the 2003 Super Bowl Every office needs a fiery backer to keep slackers and rule breakers in line He s simply an enforcer it s 100 percent heart baby He even teaches marginalism in his spare time 11 Kris Humphries Becomes a Kardashian Despite a prenup and a ridiculous 72 days of marriage already scripted the Kardumphries divorce continues to drag on in embarrassing fashion Considering this relationship was probably never real it s amazing it got more sports coverage than the 1980 Miracle on Ice We re done keeping up with the two headed monster dubbed Kardumphries 10 Hal Mcrae Goes for Gold While being questioned following a 5 3 loss to the Tigers in 1993 Royals coach Hal McRae bit the bait and engaged in the most memorable minute and a half of his life It wasn t even complete until his 360 degree phone toss 45 seconds in 10s across the board 9 Malice at the Palice Things were hot from the start during this 04 game between the Pistons and Pacers They began to spark when center Ben Wallace shoved the former Ron Artest They ignited into flames when a fan tossed an unknown drink at Artest an ice cube the final straw perhaps Pure mayhem 10 million in forfeited paychecks and 146 games worth of suspensions would result 8 John Cheney Doesn t Take Defeat Lightly After his 13th ranked UMass team upset No 8 Temple by one point in February of 1994 John Calipari received the lashing of a lifetime from frustrated coach John Chaney during the routine press conference A quintessential Goosefraba moment 7 Tim Tebow s Turns Water into Coverage One small step for Tim Tebow one giant leap for media kind We hadn t seen the country so enamored since Neil Armstrong first stepped on the moon Tebow s rainy prance across the field detailed the status of today s sports coverage 6 Kellen Winslow s Battle Cry Easily the most passionate and hard fought performance of Kellen Winslow s career Following Miami s heartbreaking loss to the Vols the talented tight end was not in the mood for sissy talk Reality check your father was a true soldier 5 The Case of Chi Town s Steve Bartman Nearly nine years later it s time to accept the truth Steve Bartman s foul ball attempt did not ruin the Cubs during the 03 NLCS against the Marlins Perhaps the most scrutinized fan moment in baseball history deserves to be released Then Chicago ace Mark Prior said it best We had chances to get out of that situation I hung an 0 2 curveball to Ivan Rodriguez that he hit for a single Alex Gonzalez who s a sure thing almost at shortstop the ball came up on him We still had some chances to get out of that inning and unfortunately we didn t execute and things just snowballed from there True 4 Phillip Wellman Makes a Memory Step aside Lou Piniella we ve got former Braves skipper Phillip Wellman in the house A three game suspension seemed worth the visual masterpiece It had all the makings of a Broadway hit 3 Remembering Andres Escobar In doing what any defender would do in that situation prevent the ball from scampering across the middle of the box Andres Escobar made rare history His own goal would secure a 2 1 upset U S victory over the heavily favored Brazilians And it would cost Escobar his life Passion got the best of his country Humberto Castro Munoz a bodyguard for a heavy Colombian cartel was charged with his murder But mystery remains 2 Suzyn Waldman Ignites the Rocket Oh my good goodness gracious it s the Rocket When he s getting paid a speck over 28 million it s not as dramatic as shocking sportscaster Suzyn Waldman made it seem Her encore came this year when she called John Sterling John Sterns Breathtaking stuff 1 David Bennett Rains Cats and Dogs Coastal Carolina coach David Bennett tried to motivate educate and story tell all at the same time last year The reigning Big South Coach of the Year had us at Twelve cats live across the road our door s open screen s broke Bennett would make a legendary Southern preacher rankings\/list, multiple sports, b\/r swagger, partner swagger there was a time when rough wakeups

players"",""body"":""If you like this story feel free to share 10 Stephan Lebeau Stephan Lebeau would chew between 20 25 sticks of gum in his team s locker room He would then throw the gum out exactly two minutes before the game s opening face off Chewing all that gum must have revved his entire body up because in 373 NHL regular season games between the Montreal Canadiens and Anaheim Ducks he totaled 277 points He also helped the Montreal Canadiens win the Stanley Cup in 1992 93 9 Stephane Quintal Stephane Quintal wouldn t talk to anyone past 1 30 PM on game days He wouldn t reply to conversations or answer any phone calls I guess you can t call him motor mouth Despite being quiet he had a pretty rowdy career with 1 320 penalty minutes in 1 037 NHL regular season games 8 Karl Alzner Born in Burnaby British Columbia it s no wonder that Karl Alzner is a fan of the Canadian National Anthem But what he does during the anthem is a bit odd While the Canadian National Anthem is playing he taps his hockey stick 88 times He also traces the outline of the Canadian maple leaf while the music is playing He was drafted fifth overall in 2007 by Washington and has spent the first three seasons of his NHL career with the Capitals And considering Washington is located in the United States Alzner s Canadian Anthem ritual doesn t happen every night Maybe he should consider a more routine superstition 7 Glenn Hall Glenn Hall s nickname was Mr Goalie but I think a more suitable name would have been Mr Sick Hall would make himself throw up before every game because he thought it would make him play better I guess the superstition worked pretty well as his record was 407 wins 326 losses 163 ties and 84 shutouts in 906 NHL regular season games Coincidentally another NHL goaltender Darren Pang also vomited before each game saying that it made him more agile in the net 6 Joe Nieuwendyk Known as one of the greatest face off men in NHL history Joe Nieuwendyk also had a couple of superstitions he followed regularly Prior to every NHL game he played he would eat exactly two pieces of toast with peanut butter on them Even more bizarre he would sprinkle baby powder on the blade of his hockey stick He believed the baby powder had some magical powers that helped him score goals Perhaps it worked as Nieuwendyk totaled 564 goals and 1 126 points in 1 257 NHL regular season games 5 Pelle Lindbergh Former Philadelphia Flyers goaltender Pelle Lindbergh use to wear the same orange t shirt under his equipment during each hockey game The t shirt was never washed and when it would start falling apart he would have it sewn up During intermissions he would drink a Swedish beverage called Pripps He would only accept the drink if it had two ice cubes was delivered by a certain team trainer and as long as it was in his right hand Lindbergh s quirky habits helped him on the ice with a record of 87 wins 49 losses and 15 ties in 157 NHL regular season games Unfortunately Lindbergh died as a result of a devastating car crash at just 26 years of age 4 Brendan Shanahan Known as a great power forward Brendan Shanahan had some pretty quirky superstitions during his NHL career He would wear old shoulder pads that dated back to his days in junior hockey He would also listen to Madonna on game days Obviously the Material Girl and ancient shoulder pads worked in Shanahan s favor as he recorded 1 354 points in 1 524 NHL regular season games 3 Sidney Crosby Sidney Crosby could very well be the most superstitious player currently in the NHL He will not call his mother on game days as some of his past injuries occurred after he was talking to her If he s travelling with his team on a bus he will lift his feet and touch the glass when they go over railroad tracks If his team is playing on the road he ll only use tape that s provided by the home team for his sticks And when he s done taping his sticks nobody is allowed to touch them or else he ll have to re tape them Crosby must be doing something right as he s one of the best hockey players to ever play the game He has won numerous awards including the Stanley Cup in just his fourth NHL season 2 Patrick Roy Hall of Fame goaltender Patrick Roy had a long list of superstitions He would never talk to reporters on game days before he played During pre game warm ups he would skate to the blue line stare at his net and picture it shrinking He would also never step on the blue or red lines Prior to the games he would lay out his goalie equipment on the locker room floor and dress himself in a certain order Then during intermissions he would juggle with a puck and bounce it off the ground And if those weren t bad enough he would quite often talk to his goal posts claiming they are my friends Apparently his goal posts were extremely loyal friends as he holds numerous NHL records and won many trophies during his incredible career including four Stanley Cups 1 Wayne Gretzky Wayne Gretzky is one of the most superstitious players in NHL history He wouldn t get his hair cut while his team was on the road because one time when he did his team suffered a major loss During practice he would start off by shooting a puck to the right of the net He would then drink a Diet Coke a glass of iced water a Gatorade and another Diet Coke in that exact order As for his uniform he would always put the left side on first and he would always tuck in the right side of his jersey Also he would put baby powder on the blade of his hockey stick He most definitely lived up to his nickname The Great One as he holds a large amount of NHL records won many trophies and averaged almost two points a game during his illustrious career 2 857 points in 1 487 games Image sources http

useful information Sarah Nicholson sent in the following useful advice If available in your area take advantage of online or telephone grocery shopping particularly for bulky or heavy items Often the delivery charge can be reduced or eliminated if you choose certain time slots and spend over a certain amount Try doing a big order once or twice a month for all the non perishable items that you regularly buy such as dried canned and frozen food long life milk and juice toilet rolls washing powder cleaning products soft drinks and dairy foods these have surprisingly long sell by dates Buy extra if anything you regularly use is on special offer This route also has the advantage that you will not be tempted to spend more by buying extras you see in the store Even if a delivery service is not available in your area you can adopt the same principle for a monthly supermarket trip roping in the family to help Then you only need to do a quick 10 15 minute shopping raid once or twice a week

donuts?"",""body"":""Do you like doughnuts How about donuts Why are there 2 spellings Personally I prefer doughnuts I don t have a good reason but I think the Southern part of my brain likes the extra letters Donuts is just so short and curt whereas doughnuts you can kind of linger over just slow down and take your time letting the word roll off your tongue Well like I said I don t have a good reason but I still prefer doughnuts to donuts I have been craving doughnuts for weeks And not just doughnuts Homemade doughnuts Even though I have never made doughnuts before Even though it has been years more years than I care to count since I ve had a homemade doughnut and that one was made by my mom and was not a raised doughnut but rather a cakey donut hole still delicious and fried But frying takes effort Frying requires time And so I put it off And the craving beckoned and then it beseeched And still I put it off But that sneaky craving oh it finally got me it nudged me toward a packet of yeast and convinced me that frying would be simple and wavy hand gestured me into forgetting that I only had my cast iron skillet and no dutch oven in which to fry Well it worked I caved I made doughnuts They were delicious I had to call up a friend to remove half of them from the premises lest they all would end up in my belly But and this bugs me it was not an efficient doughnut production I have a standard 12 inch cast iron skillet and I love it But it is not meant for deep frying A thermometer does not reach the oil if it is stood on its end properly so I had to tilt it and lay it on its side to get the temperature of the oil and so the thermometer became a little bridge under which an occasional doughnut would float and sometimes get stuck It was not horrible but it was not fluid and easy And I like my cooking to be fluid and easy The right tool for the job would have been a dutch oven which I do have but at some point migrated to Dan s house and has not returned So on the doughnut obsessed day I could have driven to Dan s to pick it up But that isn t how obsessions work at least not in my world But even with all my whining I do not regret the end results In fact the doughnut holes were well let s just say if I had eaten just a few more no one would have ever known I made doughnut holes Yes that good I also love the process of coating the holes with powdered sugar putting them in a paper bag and shaking vigorously What So I m easily amused For the doughnuts I used Alton Brown s yeast doughnut recipe I don t have a kitchen scale so this was really the first not having the right tool in my doughnut adventure The recipe Mr Brown supplies gives the weight of the flour I could not find a straight conversion from weight to cups which makes sense since flour can compact and compress and you could measure 2 cups out with differing weights So I approximated as best I could I put a big bowl onto my bathroom scale yes it looked ridiculous to have a bowl on my bathroom scale and no I did not do the measuring in the bathroom I measured the weight of the bowl by itself and then I scooped flour into the bowl until I got close to 23 ounces It was fuzzy math for sure I think I wound up using about 3 5 cups of flour give or take 1 2 cup I don t recommend this method of weighing flour Maybe its time to invest in a kitchen scale The doughnut holes got 2 treatments the first simply powdered sugar With only powdered sugar you can really taste the nutmeg in the dough The 2nd batch of holes were shaken up in cinnamon sugar Also very tasty As for the doughnuts themselves I used a bit of leftover chocolate ganache for a chocolate glaze ganache really does go with everything and made a simple maple glaze My favorite was the doughnut holes both kinds Dan s favorite was the chocolate glazed The maple was good too even if it wasn t as mapley as I d like RecipesDoughnuts see Alton Brown s recipe here Chocolate glaze any chocolate ganache will do

dessert is the dessert that is a dazzler crowd pleaser and would fool even the toughest vegan dessert skeptic I don t know about you but double chocolate pretty much always wins in my books so my Chilled Double Chocolate Torte is at the top of the list It s also Eric s favourite dessert I made this torte back in December after visiting The Coup and being unsatisfied with the texture and taste of their tofu based chocolate torte If you haven t figured it out by now I m not a big fan of tofu Instead I used avocado to create a creamy mousse on top of a wholesome chocolaty spelt crust And don t worry you can t taste the avocado at all I ve served this to many skeptics and no one can believe the ingredient list I ve always secretly called this the PMS torte because Eric likes to mention it whenever I start feeling moody and hormonal And he s still alive Now if I could just get him to make it for me then I d be set PMS aside it s chilled in the freezer so it makes a great warm weather dessert The avocado mousse remains firm in the freezer but not frozen solid making this a great treat to pop out of the freezer whenever the craving strikes which is pretty much the entire time it s calling your name from the freezer Earlier this week when I saw Jenna make it I realized there was just one thing missing this recipe still requires that you turn on the oven I pictured that California girl sweating over a piping hot stove and guilt set in Turning the oven on during hot weather sometimes feels like turning on a space heater at your desk because your office cranks the A C too much It just doesn t make sense But I ll save Eric s office plights for another time Given our warm weather this week I decided to make a nutty no bake crust to really bring this torte into full Summer mode No oven required And let s be real I really don t want an oven getting in the way of my chocolate fix It s time to cut out the middle man Chilled Double Chocolate Torte The No Bake Version Crust from Healthy Hoggin Chocolate avocado mousse from my Chilled Double Chocolate Torte No Bake Chocolate Crust 2 cups pecans 1 4 cup cocoa powder 2 tbsp coconut oil other light taste oil may work 1 4 cup pure maple syrup 1 tsp pure vanilla extract 1 2 tsp kosher salt Chocolate Avocado Mousse 2 cups avocado flesh approx 3 small avocados pitted and scooped out 1 3 cup almond milk 2 3 cup pure maple syrup 1 tbsp smooth peanut butter or other nut butter 1 tbsp arrowroot powder 1 4 tsp kosher salt 1 tsp pure vanilla extract 1 cup 2 tbsp chocolate chips melted 1 4 cup cocoa powder sifted if clumpy Directions 1 Crust Oil a 7 10 inch springform pan and line it with a circle of parchment paper In a food processor pulse the pecans until crumbly Be careful not to over process them as you still want them a bit chunky Now add in the rest of the crust ingredients and pulse until just mixed Scoop mixture onto prepared pan and press down firmly and evenly with slightly wet fingers or a spatula Pop into freezer to set while making the mousse 2 Chocolate mousse Place all mousse ingredients except chocolate chips into food processor Process until smooth In a small bowl melt your chocolate chips in the microwave and scoop melted chocolate into food processor mixture Process until smooth 3 Remove crust from freezer and scoop this mousse on top of crust Smooth out as much as possible and then place in the freezer for 2 hours to firm 4 Once firm remove from freezer and allow to sit on the counter for about 5 10 minutes before serving chilled Place leftover torte in the freezer wrapped and placed in a seal container Note that this torte should be served chilled as it gets soft at room temperature Thanks to Healthy Hoggin s chocolate crust this worked out beautifully No flops no trial 2 3 or 4 Just perfection The chocolate pecan crust adds an irresistible nutty and slightly salty flavour which is a perfect contrast to the rich chocolaty mousse The crust is quite thin when made in a 10 inch pan so next time I might make this in a 7 or 8 inch cake pan for more height It might also be fun to make this in a muffin tin with muffin liners for single servings treats Or in a square pan and cut into bite sized squares It probably goes without saying but when you make individual servings you get to eat one without your guests being the wiser It s a bit more difficult to hide the fact that you already enjoyed a slice of the pie before they came over Or two Not that I m speaking from experience or anything Have yourself a sweet Friday Possibly Related

vegetables"",""body"":""NaturalNews The FDA has announced that beginning today spinach and lettuce sold across the United States may now be secretly irradiated before it reaches grocery store shelves What s secret about it The FDA previously decided that irradiation warning stickers would not be required on any food items because it would be too confusing to consumers The word IRRADIATION apparently has too many letters to be understood to food buyers Thus irradiated foods will not be labeled as such and consumers are going to be left in the dark about all this except for those who actually eat the irradiated food in which case they will glow in the dark The FDA of course insists that the levels of irradiation used to kill e coli will have no effect whatsoever on the nutritional value of the food This astonishing statement comes from an agency that doesn t believe food has any nutritional value in the first place so lowering the value to zero by destroying all the phytonutrients does not in the opinion of the FDA alter its nutritional value at all Thus destroying all the anti cancer nutrients in a head of broccoli merely brings that broccoli into compliance as a non functional food according to the FDA Radiation of course destroys delicate phytochemicals in plants the very phytochemicals protecting consumers against cancer heart disease high cholesterol inflammation and other diseases Microwaving broccoli for example destroys up to 98 of its anti cancer nutrients The FDA has not yet acknowledged this scientific fact either In a similar way irradiating food destroys much of its nutritional content including vitamins carotenoids anthocyanins and other delicate protective nutrients that are right now providing the last desperate nutritional defense against the American diet of meat milk fried foods and processed junk Irradiating fresh produce will leave the U S population is a state of extreme deficiency in protective plant based nutrients Many people suspect that s what the FDA really wants A nutritionally deficient disease ridden population would mean a windfall of profits for the FDA s buddies in Big Pharma the folks who sell patented medications at monopoly prices With the food supply destroyed by radiation ordinary people would have virtually no remaining sources of protective phytonutrients In promoting this food radiation policy the FDA has accomplished what all the terrorists in the world could not The mass irradiation of the U S food supply much like setting off a dirty bomb over the nation s farms but with less radiation This destruction of the nutritional value of the food supply is a far greater threat to the health of the U S population than any terrorist event including 9 11 And yet it is being done by our own people TO our own people by a lawless agency that answers to no one FDA officials are not voted into office by the People they are appointed by politicians They answer to no one they refuse to follow federal law and they operate as tyrants over a quarter of the U S economy And now they have taken it upon themselves to destroy the national food supply We should be more than just alarmed we should be outraged The FDA has committed an act of war against the People With this decision the FDA has firmly positioned itself as an enemy of the People and a bringer of death and disease to the nation Why are our elected representatives in Washington allowing this madness Think about this If the FDA has its way All your food will be irradiated pasteurized or killed All your children will be vaccinated All your medicine will be based on pharmaceuticals All your free speech about health will be suppressed All informative labeling on food and supplements will be outlawed Growing and selling non irradiated garden vegetables will become a crime Don t think the FDA will stop with spinach and lettuce either They re already talking about irradiating tomatoes peppers and onions Before long radiation could become mandatory for ALL fresh produce and all the fresh fruits and vegetables that are supposed to contain health protecting nutrients will be transformed into sterile inert plant mass with no health benefits at all Brilliant scam huh This is by design I believe the FDA wants the American public to be sickened and diseased Why else would they ban Free Speech about healing foods like cherries broccoli and garlic Why would they outlaw the selling of herbs and nutritional supplements that claim to treat and prevent disease The FDA wants you to be sick enslaved and medicated and irradiating the food supply is the quickest way to accomplish that He who controls the food controls the People He who destroys the food can profit from the People s sickness In pushing this radiation agenda the FDA is committing a crime against humanity a nutritional atrocity that violates fundamental human rights And yet the FDA s top decision makers continue to operate with zero oversight and zero accountability They make decisions in a corporate sponsored vacuum absent any input from reasonable health conscious consumers or scientists And because they have been granted tyrannical powers by Congress the FDA operates above the law It is not subject to any laws whatsoever not even the U S Constitution which is supposed to protect the People s right to Life Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness as stated in the Declaration of Independence The mass irradiation of the food supply is a violation of the Life part of that phrase wouldn t you agree If we can no longer buy nourishing foods with their nutrients intact then we are all doomed to degenerative disease and death but not before paying out our life savings to doctors drug companies and hospitals That s the evil genius of the food irradiation plot It kills you slowly at just the right pace to drain your bank account before you expire from malnutrition I truly believe this irradiation of the food supply is the beginning of the end of America No nation can survive the destruction of its food supply The FDA is dooming America to a slow painful medicated death In a generation this nation will be lost destroyed from within by short sighted tyrants who violated nature and left the People to rot For starters you can 1 Grow your own food A little gardening is good Grow whatever you can even if it s just a few kitchen herbs 2 Buy your food at farmer s markets coops and CSAs See http www localharvest org csa3 Ask your grocery store if they are buying irradiated spinach If they don t know demand they find out 4 Raise hell with your Senators and Congresspeople demanding they pass new laws protecting consumers from the FDA and its plot to destroy the nutritional value of the food supply Also listen to two podcasts I ve posted on this topic The first was recorded several months ago where I publicly predicted the FDA would do exactly what we re seeing right now Listen to that podcast here http www naturalnews com Index Po The second podcast was just posted today I recorded it right before writing this article It goes into much greater detail about the FDA s plot to destroy the health of the U S population You can listen to that here http www naturalnews com Index Po Finally don t stand for this food supply madness Raise your voice Write your local paper call your representatives in Washington and tell them you strongly oppose the irradiation of the food supply Teach people about phytonutrients And stay tuned to NaturalNews as we continue to cover this important story The FDA has gone mad Criminally mad It is an agency that will literally kill you if given the chance and it is up to all of us to stop this madness before we lose our health our children and our very nation

Tomato Kalamata Olive Basil Pesto Focaccia Now could not be a better time to take the Tasty and Healthy New Year Challenge with Virtual Potluck and reevaluate the brands you are using in your kitchen California Olive Ranch COR and Bob s Red Mill BRM have teamed up with Virtual Potluck in January to bring you the healthiest and most delicious recipes possible along with fabulous giveaways Our plan is to help you incorporate better foods into your diet such as olive oil and whole grains This weeks challenge is appetizers Each week all twelve of the Virtual Potluck bloggers will introduce a new recipe using one product from Bob s Red Mill and one from California Olive Ranch That is twelve chances to win spectacular products This week I decided to make Sun dried Tomato Kalamata Olive and Basil Pesto Focaccia If you would like to know more about Focaccia click here I have chosen to work with Arbequina Olive Oil which is fresh fruity and has a flavor profile of tropical fruit and fresh artichoke It is best used on salad greens and in garden pestos I have also chosen Organic 100 Stone Ground Hard White Whole Wheat Flour to work with from Bob s Red Mill It contains all of the healthy ingredients from the wheat berry including the germ bran and fiber from the endosperm COR BRM Since 1978 when their doors opened Bobs Red Mill has used traditional time honored techniques in milling and their stone grinding mills are much like the ones used during early Roman times Their quartz millstones produce a finer product unlike high speed steel rollers and their stone mills ensure the most nutritious parts of the whole grain remain so the all natural goodness is packed right into your bag If you want to see the mill in action click here California Olive Ranch has a legacy that spans 300 years when the Spanish brought the olive trees to California They grow and harvest all of their own olives and cold press within hours of picking to bring you the freshest product possible Every 100 recyclable bottle displays the harvest date and is in specified green glass to protect the olive oil from light keeping it fresher longer I especially love the olive shaped finger grips on the side of the bottle to ensure the perfect pour If you want to read more articles on COR s award winning olive oil click here Making the dough When trying olive oil remember the four S s swirl smell slurp and swallow Head Miller for California Olive Ranch Bob Singletary has conducted thousands of tastings throughout his career Click here for his tips on properly tasting olive oil and here to learn more about the people that bring you this wonderful product When making the healthy decision to invest in yourself by purchasing quality products such as California Olive Ranch Olive Oils there are a few tips you should know Check the date on the olive oil in your pantry It needs to be consumed when young and discarded within a year of bottling as it can become rancid I prefer to purchase smaller bottles and avoid the super sized to ensure freshness You will want to store your bottles in a cool dark location in an airtight container away from sunlight and heat from the oven or stove When deciding on my recipe this week I had help from my husband and my daughter who is home for the holidays from college She is studying nursing and just finished a class in nutrition My degree is in health and my husband is a surgeon so it was fun being able to discuss the Healthy New Year Challenge with them Since my daughter is a huge fan of pesto and we all adore kalamata olives we came up with our Sun dried Tomato Kalamata Olive and Basil Pesto Focaccia Though it was to be an appetizer I paired it with a beautiful salad of local greens from my Seaside Farmer s Market I also used the Arbequina drizzled on top as a dressing This was a delightful challenge aside from a few technical difficulties with my computer and the recipe is easy to prepare After rolling out the dough I coated it with the Arbequina Olive Oil then spread the pesto on top I added the julienned sun dried tomatoes cut the kalamata olives in pieces with kitchen shears and sprinkled shaved parmesan cheese and sea salt on top It was irresistible Couldn t resist Sundried Tomato Kalamata Olive and Basil Pesto Focaccia Ingredients 1 teaspoon sugar 1 25 ounce package active dry yeast 1 3 cup warm water 110 degrees F 45 degrees C 2 cups BRM whole wheat flour 2 tablespoons COR Arbequina Olive Oil 1 4 teaspoon salt Preparation In a small bowl dissolve sugar and yeast in warm water Let stand until creamy about 10

highly critical of them "",""body"":""Phoenix police raid home of blogger whose writing is highly critical of themApril 2nd 2009 source Carlos MillerIn what should send a frightening chill down the spine of every blogger writer journalist and First Amendment advocate in the United States Phoenix police raided the home of a blogger who has been highly critical of the department Jeff Pataky who runs Bad Phoenix Cops said the officers confiscated three computers routers modems hard drives memory cards and everything necessary to continue blogging The 41 year old software engineer said they also confiscated numerous personal files and documents relating to a pending lawsuit he has against the department alleging harassment which he says makes it obvious the raid was an act of retaliation Maricopa County Judge Gary Donahoe signed the search warrant that allowed at least ten cops to raid his home in North Phoenix on March 12 while handcuffing his female roommate for three hours as they tore the place apart Pataky who was out of town on a business trip during the raid also believes police were retaliating against him for the content of his blog much of it which comes from inside sources within the department They broke into my safe and took the backups of my backups he said in a phone interview with Photography is Not a Crime on Wednesday I can t even file my taxes because all my business plans are gone They took everything The search warrant lists petty theft and computer tampering with the intent to harass as probable causes He has yet to see an actual affidavit that lists in detail the probable cause and is skeptical that one even exists They say everything has been sealed he said The conflict between Pataky and the Phoenix Police Department began two years ago during a nasty divorce after moving out of the house he had shared with his wife His said she was not taking the divorce too well and began filing false allegations against him accusing him of stalking and harassing her Many of the reports she filed accused him of doing things when he was out of town he said So he began filing complaints with everybody from Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon down to Phoenix Police Chief Jack Harris to no avail He was eventually indicted for harassing his ex wife A month before the trial he and a few friends launched the website as a rant against the police department When he went to trial in May 2008 his charges were immediately dismissed because of lack of evidence he said We were going to shut down the website after that but then all of a sudden all these good cops started hitting the site and sending us tips he said He said they would also deliver all kinds of internal documents from within the department exposing everything from a cop with multiple DUIs to another cop whose son was a child molester and was trying to get on the force and was eventually arrested We have about 50 to 100 retired and active cops who provide us information he said Police apparently believe one of the tipsters is an officer named David Barnes who fell out of favor with the department in 2007 when he was a detective and went public with claims of mismanaged evidence at the city crime lab Police also raided Barnes home and according to Pataky s inside sources plan to raid the homes of more cops Police have been extremely vague about the nature of the raids according to the arizona republic Police officials said Wednesday that a Phoenix detective prompted the investigation after complaining about harassment though they declined further comment Phoenix Assistant Chief Andy Anderson said the harassment case is unique because of the connection to an unaccredited grassroots Web site He said the blog is one part of the case though he did not provide specifics of the ongoing investigation This isn t about the blog Anderson said That s just where the investigation led The allegation of petty theft against Pataky stem from photos he posted on his blog of police name plates that appear to have been taken from within the department He said he actually made the plates himself The allegation of computer tampering with the intent to harass obviously has to do with his no holds barred criticism of the department Pataky who has since purchased a new laptop is taking the raid in stride and has added it to the allegations in his pending lawsuit And he has not let it stop him from blogging They thought they were going to scare us into a corner but they just made us stronger "",""url"":""70news 2009 04 03 shocking phoenix police raid

"",""body"":""NINE STARS OUR HIGHEST RANKING Right out of the box there seemed to be something a bit different about our new Apollo Extreme Starter Kit The components appeared to be a little larger than what we had been used to seeing Measuring one of the two lithium ion cigarette style batteries confirmed our first impression At 3\u215c inches in length the Apollo Extreme is about a half inch longer than most electronic cigarette batteries Double end capped and plugged to maintain freshness the cartridge atomizers are longer as well measuring 1\u215d inches as opposed to the standard 1\u00bc inches In addition to the two batteries and five cartridge atomizers the Apollo Extreme Starter Kit includes the user manual a USB charger an AC wall adaptor and a car charger adaptor an accessory that is not often included in starter kits Currently priced at five for 15 00 Apollo Extreme cartridge atomizers are available in Tobacco Menthol Vanilla Coffee and Cherry flavors in your choice of High Medium Low and Zero Nicotine levels Order 11 or more packs for bulk pricing of 5 cartridge atomizers for 12 50 We next screwed a Tobacco High cartridge atomizer onto the battery and took a good drag We were rewarded with satisfying tobacco flavor and exhaled an expansive plume of beautiful white vapor So far So good A second drag produced the same result a rich tobacco flavor and an impressive white vapor cloud Drawing on the Apollo was quiet and easy There were no crackling or popping sounds an unfortunate quality we have come to associate with lesser e cigarette brands Pleased with our first Apollo Electronic Cigarette experience we set one of the batteries to charge and decided to resume our testing the next day The following day we unplugged our now fully charged battery and screwed it onto another Tobacco High cartridge atomizer We took our first drag and were once again well pleased with the resulting flavor and vapor Apollo Extreme was proving to be a new smoking pleasure While the Apollo Extreme excels in many ways perhaps the most remarkable thing about it is the price Editor Top 5 Electronic Cigarettes Handling the Apollo Extreme one cannot help but notice that the slightly larger and heavier components are well designed and crafted The excellent fit and finish are complimented by long lasting cartridge atomizers equal to about a pack and a half of cigarettes and superior battery life The more we smoked our Apollo e cigarette the better we liked it While the Apollo Extreme excels in many ways perhaps the most remarkable thing about it is the price At 54 95 it is priced substantially lower than comparably equipped starter kits of lesser quality and provides a superior value that is difficult to beat Additionally and unlike most electronic cigarette retailers Apollo owns its own factories and labs Investment in the research and development of e cigarette technology is yet another reason to believe that one you are buying from Apollo you are purchasing a state of the art product from a company that stands behind its products if you are a one pack a day or more smoker interested in making the switch to electric we could hardly think of a better choice than Apollo Extreme It gets the job done beautifully it s a joy to smoke and it s inexpensive Editor Top 5 Electronic Cigarettes We tried to think of downsides to the Apollo Extreme and came up with only one possibility It is slightly larger than the average electronic cigarette about 4 measuring 4\u215e fully assembled It is similar in size and weight to Green Smoke when using the longer of the two supplied batteries and the new FlavorMax cartridge atomizers The positives associated with the larger size are however substantial The 3\u215c 280mAh battery will last longer than a standard cigarette style battery and the larger cartridge atomizer provides about a pack and a half worth of smoking with superior vapor volume If you are a social smoker making the switch to e cigarettes the Apollo Extreme may not be the right choice for you But if you are a one pack a day or more smoker interested in making the switch to electric we could hardly think of a better choice than Apollo Extreme It gets the job done beautifully it s a joy to smoke and it s inexpensive We estimated that including the starter kit purchase the cost to maintain a one pack per day cigarette habit using Apollo Extreme was only 762 45 annually or 63 54 per month or 14 66 per week or only 2 09 per day We found Apollo Extreme to be a superior value when compared to the cost of traditional cigarettes and the same one pack per day habit at 6 00 per pack or 2190 00 per year or 182 50 per month or 42 12 per week or 6 00 per day The annual savings for an Apollo Extreme smoker is 1427 55 In summary we found Apollo Extreme Starter Kit at 54 95 to be a superior value Shipping is free and in addition to the one year limited warranty it includes a 30 day money back guarantee big pluses in our book These factors and others account for Apollo Extreme earning our highest ranking as the best electronic cigarette currently available FINAL JUDGMENT Apollo Extreme has earned 9 STARS and OUR HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION in summary, we found apollo extreme starter kit at $54.95 to be a superior value. shipping is free, and in addition to the one-year limited warranty, it includes a 30-day, money-back guarantee - big pluses in our book. these factors and others account for apollo extreme earning our highest-ranking as the best electronic cigarette currently available.""}"	"?"

fans ran wild Wednesday night after the Vancouver Canucks 4 0 loss to Boston in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals setting cars and garbage cans ablaze smashing windows showering giant TV screens with beer bottles and dancing atop overturned vehicles Later looters smashed windows and ran inside department stores We have a small number of hooligans on the streets of Vancouver causing problems Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson said It s absolutely disgraceful and shameful and by no means represents the city of Vancouver We have had an extraordinary run in the playoff great celebration What s happened tonight is despicable Police said they had reports of four stabbings though spokeswoman Const Jana McGuinness said she couldn t confirm them Officers from around the region flooded into downtown and Robertson said things were getting under control but the images and atmosphere that persisted late into the night suggested otherwise It took about four hours before downtown quieted again While Robertson said there had been no fatalities ambulances appeared to be having trouble getting inside the zone to help the injured TV images showed at least one woman mopping blood from her forehead You don t ever hope for a situation like this McGuinness said You celebrate the good times and you prepare for the bad times and that s exactly what we ve done Unfortunately the tables have turned tonight We will have to sit down and evaluate exactly what happened here It s going to be a black mark for a very very long time At a Bay store looters were seen grabbing T shirts and anything else they could get their hands on Young women were seen escaping with MAC cosmetics with one carrying out part of a mannequin The landmark building was filling with smoke as people their faces covered in bandannas continued the violence The Bay became a target with windows smashed to allow looters to get to the expensive Coach and Burberry purses Merchandise went flying into the street Women rampaged through the main floor makeup department tossing each other products and squealing in delight Another fire erupted nearby in an area littered with abandoned Canucks memorabilia and hand lettered signs expressing support for the team The violence appeared to start when fans set fire to a stuffed bear decorated to symbolize the Bruins Others sang a drunken tune as they danced on an overturned vehicle It s terrible Canucks captain Henrik Sedin said shaking his head This city and province has a lot to be proud of the team we have and the guys we have in here It s too bad The looters turned their attention next on a Future Shop store a few blocks away smashing windows and flooding up the stairs to the second floor store only to turn around quickly One witness said police were at the top of the stairs Sears and Chapters stores were also looted their glass fronts smashed For many the ugly chaos made the Cup loss an afterthought What I ve seen is a complete disgrace said Beth Hope 28 who is originally from England but has lived in Vancouver for two years I m a Canucks fan but my jersey s in my bag I m ashamed to be a fan right now Hope said she saw a parkade on fire and cars ablaze It s insane it s absolutely insane she said What s the point Our team lost Why destroy your own city I m afraid NBA star Steve Nash from nearby Victoria and the brother in law of Canucks forward Manny Malhotra sent a Twitter message imploring the fans to stop the violence We re a great city and have a lot of class Our team is great and our championship will come Soon Nash wrote Robertson praised the police and firefighters and asked people to stay away from the central downtown area It is extremely disappointing to see the situation in downtown Vancouver turn violent after tonight s Stanley Cup game Robertson said Vancouver is a world class city and it is embarrassing and shameful to see the type of violence and disorder we ve seen tonight The vast majority of people who were in the downtown tonight were there to enjoy the game in a peaceful and respectful manner It is unfortunate that a small number of people intent on criminal activity have turned pockets of the downtown into areas involving destruction of property and confrontations with police Tear gas mingled with the stench of acrid smoke and stale beer as riot police truncheons drawn moved in to quell the violence pushing crowds away from the burning cars Later police cars also were set on fire At one point police were using flash bangs grenades that are designed to distract and disorient rather than injure to try to break up the mob This isn t what the Canucks are about said Chad McMillan 31 a Vancouver resident and Canucks fan This isn t what their fans are about This isn t what this city is about Flames leaped from at least two flipped vehicles in the middle of trash strewn streets filling the downtown core with heavy black smoke in the moments immediately following the game I heard a loud noise and turned and there was a car being stomped on by a bunch of guys 18 year old witness Brandon Sinclair said about the first few moments of violence A bunch of guys started rocking it then they flipped it over and five minutes later it was on fire and then they flipped another one It was just out of control Bright orange flames were seen shooting nearly 10 yards into the air as bystanders tossed firecrackers Television images showed a large fire burning inside a parking garage but it wasn t clear what was ablaze A small group of rioters appeared to be at the heart of the action reminiscent of a similar scene that erupted in the city in 1994 following the Canucks Game 7 loss to the New York Rangers McGuinness said those responsible for this latest damage had an average age of 22 or 23 and were downtown specifically to wreak mayhem not to watch hockey They ve embarrassed our city and taken away that pride that we had she said For two weeks the city hosted thousands of fans in areas set aside with gigantic screens for watching the games as the Canucks progressed through the playoffs Police officers high fived passers by and spectators were well behaved win or lose Game 7 was different McGuinness said police aren t blaming alcohol consumption there was more during Game 5 on Friday night But she also bristled at the notion that the force s so called meet and greet strategy was misguided I would completely disagree that there is complacency she said We are very aware in a crowd situation that things can change We watch for those flashpoints in a crowd When flames erupted from an exploding car bystanders ducked out of fear Fans who were trying simply to get out of the danger zone found their visibility reduced by the thick black smoke About an hour after the game some bold troublemakers started hurling garbage and bottles at police officers who deflected the debris with riot shields Protesters who rushed the police line were quickly subdued with blows from a truncheon Some protesters held what looked like pipes or hockey sticks over their heads as they jeered at officers Newspaper boxes were wrenched off the sidewalk and hurled through store windows Portable toilets were tipped as the stifling black smoke spread through the city s core While some members of the crowd expressed dismay that the police didn t take a more aggressive approach to the early vandalism others said officers were heavy handed There s people who ve been coming through the crowds suffering from tear gas said 26 year old Amy Zevick I m seriously disappointed in the city of Vancouver and the country of Canada because it makes me feel the insecurity I read about in other parts of the world I don t think it s OK to loot but I also don t think it s OK to over police and assume that every person is guilty Some seemed to revel in the rampage recording the vandalism on cell phones and video cameras A few congratulated those who tried to attack police and others erupted with cheers every time something was damaged At least two young men covered in soot reported being roughed up by the police but they weren t arrested Rivers of poured out alcohol broken glass and trash made navigating the streets treacherous Fans wandered amid the chaos some with bandanas or T shirts pulled over their faces either to hide their faces from police and TV cameras or to guard against the smoke or both What is most disappointing and disturbing is that we have spectators who will not go home B C Solicitor General Shirley Bond said We need everyone to pay attention we need them to leave the downtown and they need to stop treating this as a spectator sport This is a dangerous situation where people need to go home var coords 5 72 display fb bubble FloatingPrompt embed

attack"",""title"":""How Exercise Protects You from a Heart Attack "",""body"":""Researchers from Emory University School of Medicine University of Colorado at Boulder and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine decided to try to figure out exactly how exercise benefits the heart and why humans who exercise and have a heart attack have improved survival compared to non exercisers They found that a four week voluntary exercise program1 in mice protected them from experimental induced heart injury a benefit that was sustained for a full week following the last session of exercise It is well known that aerobic exercise activates the production of friendly nitric oxide eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide by activating the enzyme that helps make eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide endothelial nitric oxide synthase In turn the extra eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide helps the heart and circulation relax and blood to flow easier Interestingly the researchers found that eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide was converted by the heart and in circulation and stored as an eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide savings account eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide was attached to a protein via sulfur taking the form of nitrite and nitrosothiols This stored eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide could then be released out of the savings account as needed to help the heart or circulation function better even under stress Also of interest is that aerobic exercise activates fat burning almost immediately This study found that the activation of adrenalin receptors within white adipose tissue \u03b23 adrenergic receptors was essential for optimal eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide production and storage linking the health of white adipose tissue to the cardiovascular protective response of exercise Our study provides new evidence that nitric oxide generated during physical exercise is stored in the bloodstream and heart in the form of nitrite and nitrosothiols These more stable nitric oxide intermediates appear to be critical for the cardioprotection against a subsequent heart attack said senior author David Lefer PhD professor of surgery at Emory University School of Medicine There are several points to understand The endorphin anti inflammatory benefit from aerobic exercise tends to last about 48 hours assuming you are getting a good response to exercise This eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide response is synergistic and different Once conditioned by regular aerobic exercise then a savings account of protective eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide builds up that appears to last for approximately 1 week if exercise is stopped Both anti inflammatory mechanisms are very important to your health This animal research showed that \u03b23 adrenergic receptors were essential for this eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide response This study was not done using fat mice In overweight humans there is adrenalin resistance in white adipose tissue which is likely to blunt this healthy eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide response in overweight people On the other hand as a person loses weight while exercising aerobically then the adrenaline resistance will go away and the cardioprotective eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide will be boosted This is yet another good reason to get in a weight loss mode if you are overweight It also means that if you are really out of shape you should begin your fitness gradually as the inability to activate these \u03b23 adrenergic receptors in white adipose tissue actually causes increased cardio stress from exercise You can use nutrition to help improve this scenario This can be done by anyone who wants to enhance the eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide response and would be especially important in someone trying to get themselves onto a good exercise program and build up a better state of fitness Nutrients such as grape seed extract and Resveratrol Natural phenol or type of antioxidant found in red grapes red wine Research has shown beneficial effects as anti cancer and anti inflammatory agents along with supporting healthy blood sugar and cardiovasculature function 2 are known to boost the activity of friendly eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide by activating endothelial nitric oxide synthase Nutrients such as N acetyl cysteine whey protein MSM sulfur and R alpha lipoic acid would all provide thiol related raw materials to help make the storage compounds for eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide Unfriendly and inflammatory nitric oxide iNOS Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase This enzyme influences genes located in the neuro immune and cardiovascular system and provides immune defense against pathogens and contributes to disease progression including neurogenic inflammation iNOS2 wreaks havoc in your body brain and cardiovascular system In order to be healthy you need to have more eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide than iNOS Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase This enzyme influences genes located in the neuro immune and cardiovascular system and provides immune defense against pathogens and contributes to disease progression including neurogenic inflammation iNOS2 A great way to boost up your eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide supply is to exercise assuming you get a good response to that exercise Various nutrients can enhance your exercise response and may be very important especially for unfit people who are trying to get on a healthy path to recovering their fitness exercise, enos, inos, &#946;3-adrenergic receptors researchers from emory university school of medicine, university of colorado at boulder, and johns hopkins university school of medicine decided to try to figure out exactly how exercise benefits the heart and why humans who exercise and have a heart

leading her kingdom she s instead baking this Who could blame her The Queen of Hearts certainly gets a lot of attention Songs nursery rhymes and Disney villains are centered on her royal presence It might be because she s the monarch of the most tender of suits It might be her circus freak appearance what with her lower torso being a twin who was only half absorbed in the womb and both wearing matching robes and wimples Maybe her green thumb and affinity for tiny flowers But personally I think it s because we adore her fondness of tarts I submit the following evidence The Queen of Hearts she made some tarts all on a summer s day The Knave of Hearts he stole the tarts and took them clean away The King of Hearts called for the tarts and beat the Knave full soreThe Knave of Hearts brought back the tarts andvowed he d steal no more To have your hubby kick the heck out of a guy like he s an old soup can because he stole a tart I dare you to find a greater example of someone s love for good food Now obviously the Queen was being selfish Royalty or not she should share her tarts That s why the Knave stole them he was hungry and wanted a taste And really can you blame him I mean look at this tart Chocolate caramel more chocolate and salt What s not to love Who wouldn t steal a piece I would totally snag a slice of tart if it were just lying around but I d be smart to pack a tazer to take down kingy And if he wasn t around and I had to deal with the Queen proper well I doubt something like 5000 volts will take her down After all this is her tart we re talking about That s dedication you can appreciate Now you ve probably seen this particular tart around the Internet First on Saveur then on Lottie Doof and on Eating SF but now you re seeing it here This one is my tart Actually my first tart Ever In my desire to learn more about baking I ve been trying new things This tart is a perfect beginner s tart and though it might look daunting it isn t Furthermore avid tart bakers with more experience will appreciate how simply this tosses together for a real wow factor at any event enough to even impress a Queen The obligatory chocolate caramel tart shot Seriously go check If you do this recipe you have to take this particular photo It s one of the unsaid rules of food writing Chocolate Caramel TartThe crust for this recipe comes from Cindy Mushet s The Art and Soul of Baking and served me quite well The caramel is adapted from Lottie Doof The tart recipe as a whole is adapted from Saveur FOR THE CRUST 1 stick of unsalted butter softened1 2 cup of sugar1 large egg yolk1 cup all purpose flour2 1 2 tablespoons of Dutch processed cocoa powderFOR THE CARAMEL1 2 cup water2 cups granulated sugar1 4 cup light corn syrup1 2 cup heavy cream8 tablespoons of salted butter2 tablespoons sour creamFOR THE GANACHE1 2 cup heavy cream4 ounces extra bittersweet chocolate finely choppedSea salt or kosher salt for garnish1 Place butter and sugar in the bowl of a mixer and mix on medium for 3 minutes Scrape down the sides and add the egg yolk and beat well 2 In another bowl whisk together the flour and cocoa powder Add to the butter mixture all at once Then mix in at lowest speed until it just comes together it will have small and medium clumps Any more and it will become sticky and difficult to work with 3 Scrape dough into tart pan Press into the bottom of the tart and outward using the heel of your palm Use your fingers to pull the tart up the edge Chill for an hour in the fridge Reserve a little bit of dough to patch the shell later if necessary 4 Preheat the oven to 350F Bake tart shell for 15 minutes Check to see if the dough has cracked if so patch it with the reserved dough Bake for another 10 15 minutes keeping an eye on it to ensure it doesn t burn Cool on wire rack 5 Make the caramel In a saucepan whisk together sugar corn syrup and water and bring to a boil Cook over medium high heat until a medium dark amber color swirling occasionally Take off heat and add the cream butter and sour cream Stir together until smooth Pour into cooled tart shell and let cool to room temperature then place in the fridge to chill and set 6 Make the ganache Bring cream to a boil in a 1 qt saucepan over medium heat Put chocolate into a medium bowl and pour in hot cream let sit for 1 minute then stir slowly with a rubber spatula until smooth Pour ganache evenly over tart and refrigerate until set 4 5 hours Sprinkle tart with sea salt slice and serve chilled SERVES 8 10 I d totally smack a Knave if he pilfered this This post extolling the awesomness of this tart was actually written before I found out that Saveur had nominated me for one of their Best Food Blog Awards I ve been nominated amongst some other amazing bloggers for the category of Best Individual Post for the cheese profile on Devil s Gulch I do hope you ll all go and vote for me if you feel my post exemplifies the kind of writing you hope to see in

party sues Belleville officer "",""body"":""The city Belleville and a Belleville police officer are being sued by a man who claims he was wrongfully arrested and charged with falsely impersonating a police officer after wearing a T shirt with the word POLICE written across the front and back Adam C Weinstein of Missouri claims he was attending a pre Christmas party on Dec 23 2006 at about 11 34 p m at Crehan s Bar in Belleville according to the complaint filed Dec 22 in St Clair County Circuit Court When Weinstein initially arrived at the party he was wearing a green sweater with the black shirt bearing the word POLICE underneath the sweater After getting hot at the bar Weinstein removed his sweater to reveal the POLICE shirt the suit states Shortly afterwards Weinstein claims he was told that some police officers wanted to talk to him outside Once he arrived outside Weinstein was told to show officers his police identification the suit states But Weinstein was a licensed Emergency Medical Technician and a licensed security officer not a police officer so he had no credentials he claims Belleville police officer Jeff Vernatti placed Weinstein under arrest and placed handcuffs around his wrists but tightened them too tightly on Plaintiff according to the complaint After Weinstein asked if it was illegal to wear a T shirt with the word POLICE on it Vernatti told him to shut the f up you re real f ing stupid you are a dumb a with no common sense do you know how f ing stupid you are the suit states Vernatti then twisted Weinstein s wrists and quickly walked him across the parking lot Weinstein claims Vernatti shoved Weinstein against the police cruiser with such force that his belt buckle left an impression on his abdomen then pushed Weinstein into the back seat of the car according to the complaint When Weinstein asked Vernatti to loosen his handcuffs Vernatti instead tightened them and added a second pair onto his wrists the suit states After writing a non traffic complaint Vernatti let Weinstein go first telling him how lucky he was not to be charged with a felony and to be placed in jail Weinstein claims But before letting Weinstein leave Vernatti ordered him to take off his shirt in the cold weather according to the complaint All the while other Belleville officers stood by and did nothing the suit states Eventually Belleville s prosecuting attorney dropped the case the suit states Because of Vernatti s actions Weinstein suffered extreme emotional distress fright nervousness indignity humiliation insult loss of relationship and comfort and was forced to incur medical costs he claims Vernatti falsely arrested falsely detained illegally violently and improperly handcuffed and wrongly charged Weinstein with impersonating officers Weinstein claims He also used excessive force publicly embarrassed harassed verbally abused physically abused cause grievous and severe injuries to Weinstein violated Weinstein s protected civil rights and abused or misused their powers according to the complaint Vernatti s actions toward Weinstein were extreme and outrageous the suit states The city of Belleville failed to train its police officers in matters that do not constitute an offense failed to train its officers in matters that do not require individuals to be detained failed to implement policies and procedures to prevent against untrained officers from detaining and charging innocent individuals and failed to train and supervise competent police officers the suit states Weinstein claims his injuries were caused by someone who had final policymaking authority and that the city had a widespread practice of deliberate indifference to the prior improper conduct of Vernatti that the city s indifference is exemplified by its knowledge of previous allegations made by citizens of Vernatti s behavior that the city failed to investigate allegations and that the city failed to discipline Vernatti Belleville also failed to train other officers to stop Vernatti when he violated rights should have known that Vernatti had been accused of excessive force on at least one prior occasion and failed to prevent Vernatti s conduct on Dec 23 2006 according to the complaint In the five count suit Weinstein is seeking actual damages in excess of 250 000 punitive damages in excess of 200 000 plus attorney s fees

is one of the oldest known cultivated vegetables originating from Ethiopia with Italy currently being the world s largest producer It was valued in ancient Greece and Rome as a digestive aid available only to the wealthy due to its scarcity It was the French and Spanish explorers who fist brought artichokes to the shores of the United States and today virtually all of the globe artichokes grown in the US are produced in Castroville California Nutrients in Artichokes Globe artichokes are an excellent source of dietary fiber magnesium and the trace mineral chromium They are a very good source of Vitamin C folic acid biotin and the trace mineral manganese They are a good source of niacin riboflavin thiamin vitamin A and potassium NUTRITIONAL HIGHLIGHTS Artichoke cooked boiled salted

comprehensive breakdown of nutrients can be found in the Nutrition Database where this food can also be added to a meal planner Artichoke for Cholesterol Reduction The artichoke has strong choleretic activity promotes bile secretion in the liver and choleretics increase the excretion of cholesterol and decrease the manufacture of cholesterol in the liver The pleasant bitter taste of the artichoke is due mostly to a plant chemical called cynarin which is found in highest concentration in the leaves of the plant European scientists first discovered cynarin s ability to reduce cholesterol in the 1970 s A compound found in artichoke called luteolinis is also believed to assist with reducing LDL cholesterol In a 50 day double blind study thirty patients received 500 milligrams of pure cynarin per day and had an average 20 percent reduction in total cholesterol along with an average 15 percent reduction in triglycerides compared to a placebo group A 6 week double blind placebo controlled clinical trial of 143 patients has demonstrated the effectiveness of artichoke leaf extract ALE for lowering LDL cholesterol The decrease of total cholesterol in the group that received the extract was 18 5 compared to 8 6 in for the placebo group LDL cholesterol decrease in the ALE group was 22 9 and 6 3 for placebo LDL cholesterol HDL cholesterol ratio showed a decrease of 20 2 in the ALE group and 7 2 in the placebo group Artichoke Leaf Extract for Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptom In a trial involving 208 adults results provide support for the notion that artichoke leaf extract has potential value in relieving irritable bowel syndrome symptoms Artichoke Leaf Extract for Dyspepsia In a double blind trial 247 patients with dyspepsia digestive problems were treated with artichoke leaf extract and the results demonstrated an improvement in their dyspeptic symptoms Dyspepsia is often attributed to insufficient flow of bile from the gallbladder and there is evidence that artichoke leaf has the ability to stimulate this flow Artichoke for Healthy Liver Function The artichoke plant is a member of the thistle family and like milk thistle it benefits the liver protecting against toxins and infection A Mediterranean home recipe uses fresh artichoke leaf juice mixed with wine or water as a liver tonic Artichoke for Diabetes The carbohydrate in artichokes is in the form of inulin which has been shown to stabilize blood sugar levels in diabetes The artichokes must be fresh as the inulin will eventually convert to other sugars as the artichoke ages Artichoke Extract not a Hangover Cure Contrary to what some would like to believe a study demonstrated the ineffectiveness of artichoke extract in the cure of alcohol induced hangovers References 1 The Encyclopedia of

I don t suspect they will be slowing down especially with the holidays coming around the corner Can you believe it The holidays are coming and they will be here sooner then you think Ugh let s not even discuss it It brings on a mixed mess of excitement and anxiety Also I have decided to get into this crazy blog competition which I hope I will get to continue till the end By the way today is the last day to vote for round 1 so click on my face right over there on the right and vote I got an interesting dish planned for round 2 In the mean time I have cooked this beauty up to hold you over I had a bag of tortellini sitting in the freezer or awhile now and I had a feeling that it was time to bust it out and put it to good use The thing was I wasn t really in the mood for a red sauce I was feeling a white sauce would be better I knew I also wanted oozy gooey cheesy goodness I thought about it all morning I walked around the house while I cleaned thumping my head with my pointer finger saying Think think think It was a little reminiscent of Winne the Pooh which I am not sure is good or bad at the age of 31 I started to think about how much I love the fall and I would love to had a little fall twist to the dish Immediately I thought of sage and mushrooms and that is when it hit me mascarpone mozzarella sage and mushrooms I don t know why but I was so excited I grabbed my keys and purse and ran out to the grocery store Looking like a hot mess mind you I was in the middle of sweeping and mopping the floor after all I am almost sure I had some hair standing straight up since I hadn t put a brush in it yet However this moment wasn t about fashion that was the last thing on my mind Obviously since I was wearing paint splotched shorts out in public In fact if I had gone to Wal mart I am sure that I would have ended up on People of Wal mart luckily enough Target was closer I wore my biggest shades and a baseball cap and prayed no one would recognize me in my hot mess condition I quickly gathered all of my ingredients and headed back home Pre heat oven to 350 degrees Heat a skillet over medium high heat with 1 tbs of olive oil Add sliced sausage to the pan and cook until evenly browned Using a slotted spoon transfer the sausage to a plate and set aside In the same pan saute garlic and onions add mushrooms and saute at a medium heat until browned about 10 minutes You don t want to over cook the mushrooms because they are going to bake in the oven for an additional 30 minutes They should be brown but still firm Prepare tortellini according to package instructions Drain drizzle with olive oil cover with a kitchen towel and set aside until ready to use In a food processor combine mascarpone cheese and sage leaves process until smooth Add mascarpone cheese mixture and sausage to the mushrooms stir until smooth and creamy If using cream cheese it may be too thick add a little bit of chicken broth to thin the sauce to a desired consistency Season with salt and pepper to taste Don t be shy If you are afraid of over salting I recommend you get some kosher salt it is hard to over salt when you use kosher salt Add mushroom cream sauce to prepared tortellini and toss Spray an 8 x 8 baking dish with non stick spray Pour tortellini into baking dish Top with torn fresh mozzarella If you can get your hands on a fresh mozzarella I highly recommend it it melts so much better and smoother then packaged shredded or block mozzarella The streachy ooey gooeyness cannot be beat Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes or until cheese is brown and bubbly Remove from oven and serve garnish with minced sage Check it out Mushrooms cream sausage and cheese Cheese people I love cheese Your family is going to rain hugs and kisses on you I promise I can t tell a lie When I took my first bite I was immediately beaming with pride This stuff was good and for just a moment I was over come with a delirious case of I think I am all that insert snapping fingers heat shake and stood proud on top of my royal blue counter top arm raised and wooden spoon in hand declaring myself the queen of creamy mushroom baked tortellini awesomeness Yeah I smacked my head on the drop ceiling but what did I care I was queen of creamy mushroom baked tortellini awesomeness Ok I didn t do that but I thought about it We all have our moments of grandiose illusions If I had had room I would have gone back for seconds and thirds but this is pretty filling The tortellini was perfectly cooked the mushrooms made it earthy and the sage gave me my first taste of fall The great thing is that this is easy to change up If you don t like sage use basil If you don t like mushrooms caramelize some cubed butternut squash in a pan with butter And if you want to get really creative I bet some chopped pecan and dry cranberries would be great in this Mmmmmm I think I see another variation in the future Print Recipe Creamy Sausage Mushroom Baked Tortellini 3 links mild

between the culture of the internet and the ancien r\u00e9gime Micah White 17 Dec 2010 Twenty four hours after Julian Assange was arrested in London a beekeeper in Colorado was leaked damning evidence that may explain why 29 percent of U S honeybee colonies died last winter The confidential draft Environmental Protection Agency report suggested a connection between Bayer s bestselling pesticide clothianidin and the mysterious die off of bees In the following days leaks some minor some significant and all damaging to the status quo sprung up across the world A leaked meeting agenda suggested the Canadian Health Minister had lied in order to hide from public scrutiny efforts to privatize health care in Alberta a divulged internal Thai government report testified that the military was responsible for three civilian deaths during unrest in May contradicting earlier claims a whistleblower confessed that ten years ago he was paid by the FBI to place a backdoor in OpenBSD long presumed to be one of the most secure operating systems in the world and a lawyer in Pakistan publicly named the undercover CIA station chief responsible for unmanned drone attacks in the country The unmasked U S spy Jonathan Banks was forced to flee amidst angry popular protest And through it all Wikileaks continued to supply the world with a daily dose of secret U S State Department cables Despite nervous assurances by U S Secretary of Defense Gates that the cable leaks will have fairly modest consequences for American foreign policy it is growing increasingly clear that the emergence of Wikileaks signals a fundamental geopolitical shift The memes of transparency and the free flow of information ideals that underpin the net are finally beginning to have concrete political consequences This is truly as a commentator at the BBC put it democracy s Napster moment For just as Napster shattered the recording industry so too does the secrecy spilling movement epitomized by Wikileaks have the potential to destabilize the West s narrative and cultural hegemony This is a drama that is still unfolding Assange may be extradited disappeared or murdered Wikileaks may flourish or it may be the target of an never before imagined internet crack down France has already passed an Internet censorship law and now there is talk that the UN is working to create a similar initiative on a global scale In the weeks and months to come we can expect a fight to the finish between the culture of the internet and the ancien r\u00e9gime It is too early to know for certain who will come out the victor But what of Julian Assange the founder of Wikileaks There has been relatively little discussion of his motivations Most mainstream media dismiss him as an egoist but there is something to his self sacrificing self destructive pursuit of Truth that does not seem selfish or concerned with fame Could there be another motivation aside from egoism A story about Assange s childhood has recently come to light which may help explain the origins of Wikileaks The rumor is that Julian Assange was once a talented Australian hacker whose nom de guerre was Mendax If true this is significant because Assange worked as a researcher on Underground a 1997 book about the hacker community in which the story of Mendax figures prominently The following excerpt from Chapter 8 of Underground may be an important clue in unraveling the origins of Wikileaks One night in Adelaide when Mendax was about four his mother and a friend were returning from a meeting of anti nuclear protesters The friend claimed to have scientific evidence that the British had conducted high yield above ground nuclear tests at Maralinga a desert area in north west South Australia A 1984 Royal Commission subsequently revealed that between 1953 and 1963 the British government had tested nuclear bombs at the site forcing more than 5000 Aborigines from their native lands In December 1993 after years of stalling the British government agreed to pay sterling 20 million toward cleaning up the more than 200 square kilometres of contaminated lands Back in 1968 however the Menzies government had signed away Britain s responsibility to clean up the site In the 1970s the Australian government was still in denial about exactly what had happened at Maralinga As Mendax s mother and her friend drove through an Adelaide suburb carrying early evidence of the Maralinga tragedy they noticed they were being followed by an unmarked car They tried to lose the tail without success The friend nervous said he had to get the data to an Adelaide journalist before the police could stop him Mendax s mother quickly slipped into a back lane and the friend leapt from the car She drove off taking the police tail with her The plain clothed police pulled her over shortly after searched her car and demanded to know where her friend had gone and what had occurred at the meeting When she was less than helpful one officer told her You have a child out at 2 in the morning I think you should get out of politics lady It could be said you were an unfit mother A few days after this thinly veiled threat her friend showed up at Mendax s mother s house covered in fading bruises He said the police had beaten him up then set him up by planting hash on him I m getting out of politics he announced For the rest of the story about

Fashioned In my opinion one of the greatest triumphs of the cocktail renaissance is the rediscovery of the classic Old Fashioned I ve often spoken of how at some point after the repeal of Prohibition the Old Fashioned became lost and possibly confused with a long forgotten drink called a Smash basically a tarted up Mint Julep covered in fruit a mere husk of its former glorious self For decades bartenders just like me served a limp weak concoction consisting of a half muddled sugar cube a mashed up neon red cherry and orange a splash of whiskey and some soda water drowning the results With a little luck and a lot of hard work that s all changed with the renewed interest in classic cocktails Now at any given night at my bar you can find literally a dozen people sipping on two ounces bourbon touched with a teaspoon of sugar and two dashes of bitters garnished with a simple orange twist over a couple big ice cubes But don t try to pull that bullshit with the good people of the Great State of Wisconsin where the Brandy Old Fashioned rules supreme It s not the same drink as above it just shares a name And if you make it right really right it s a damn delicious cocktail and worthy of examination Being located in a hotel we re used to serving folks from all over the world And the first time I witnessed a guest from Wisconsin stare blankly as one of my bartenders handed over two ounces of Cognac touched with a teaspoon of sugar and two dashes of bitters and garnished with a simple orange twist over a couple big ice cubes I knew some further training was in order So in the name of making cocktails all cocktails with as much of our hearts as we can offer I present to you what I believe to be the perfect Brandy Old Fashioned Wisconsin style I start with an old fashioned glass I ve chilled in the freezer Call it a tumbler call it a double rocks glass or call it a bucket it s a glass you re familiar with To that I add two dashes of Angostura bitters and a teaspoon of sugar If I m in a hurry I use a 2 1 simple syrup but if I m going to spend some time I use a sugar cube The sugar cube is preferable here because it s going to add some friction to the muddling we re about to do Brace yourselves cocktail nerds Next I ll take a thick cut orange wedge and a cherry The usual suspect here is a grocery store maraschino cherry but I always choose a brandied Amarena cherry Remember you re going to get out what you put in so a quality cherry is going to make the drink that much better I muddle the sugar bitters orange wedge and cherry into a thick paste careful not to touch the orange peel too much as it ll bring unwanted bitterness to the party just work around the peel and pulverize that orange meat Your standard Brandy Old Fashioned brandy of choice is Korbel cheap California brandy Considering the hundreds of thousands of cases they ship to Wisconsin every year it might be considered sacrosanct to use anything else But if you want to do this right really right then do yourself a favor and use some good Cognac I have my preferred brandy you have yours At this point your typical Wisconsinite barkeep is going to add ice and finish the drink in one of two main ways sweet or sour Those who take it sweet will ask for a splash of Sprite or 7 Up those who take it sour get a dose of Collins Mix or Squirt To me it s just a way of watering down the drink so I leave out the soda and take a more cocktail y method Crushed ice is a must for me whenever I whip up a Brandy Old Fashioned I always skip the soda and let the tiny shards of ice do the work taming those strong sweet flavors and turning this into a drink you can sip slowly As for a garnish most will throw a flag of an orange wedge and a cherry spiked through with a wooden toothpick but my take here is that those things are already in the drink so I skip em Besides how pretty does that look without the goofy fruit salad perched over the top You know it s something to enjoy sipping on while you cook up some bratwurst and onions in a boiling kettle of beer before everyone comes over to watch the Packers game Drink accordingly Brandy Old Fashioned 1 sugar cube or 1 tsp 2 1 simple syrup2 dashes Angostura bitters1 orange wedge1 cherry preferably Amarena or Maraska2 oz brandy or Cognac In a chilled old fashioned glass muddle the sugar bitters orange wedge and cherry into a thick paste careful not to work the orange peel Add brandy or Cognac stir and fill glass with crushed ice and serve More Recipes Most Popular Articles Barrel Aged Cocktails A
