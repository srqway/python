portrait of his late father Hafez al Assad in Damascus Photographer Louai Bashara AFP Getty Images Syrian President Bashar al Assad has turned to his father s playbook as he seeks to end an uprising that threatens his family s 40 year reign The government s increasing brutality is reminiscent of 1982 when Hafez al Assad crushed a rebellion in the city of Hama killing thousands Assad is using tanks and artillery in cities where protesters are calling for the end of his rule At least 174 people were killed on Feb 4 said the U K based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights making it one of the deadliest days in the 11 month revolt Assad turned the barrels of his guns on his people in Syria just like his father Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan a former ally of the Syrian leader said in televised comments today We told you to show the public that you re different than your father Bashar you reap what you sow President Barack Obama also drew attention to the parallel last week Diplomatic efforts to stem the bloodshed broke down Feb 4 when Russia and China vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution by western and Arab countries to facilitate a political transition The prospect of civil war is growing as Al Arabiya reported defecting Syrian army units are taking tanks with them Dead End Street Obama has dismissed the idea of using a foreign military force to end the conflict that the UN estimates has already killed more than 5 400 people Syrian forces yesterday killed 98 people in the central city of Homs continuing an assault that started last weekend Al Jazeera reported citing activists The nationwide toll yesterday was 128 Al Jazeera said It s very important for us to resolve this without recourse to outside military intervention and I think that s possible Obama said yesterday on NBC s Today program Turkey is using all diplomatic channels to work with the international community and initiate new measures to stand by the Syrian opposition and stop Assad s deadly crackdown Erdogan said I m calling on Assad to remind him one more time that he is traveling down a dead end street Images aired by Al Arabiya yesterday showed civilians in Homs fleeing as gunfire echoed through empty streets and smoldering buildings damaged by shelling The army also shelled Idlib in the north and Zabadani near the Lebanese border The Syrian Free Army a group of soldiers who defected to the opposition will stage a retaliatory counter attack in the province of Homs Aref al Hmoud a leader of the force told BBC s Arabic television service by telephone from Hatay Turkey Father s Playbook Assad is returning to his father s playbook because he still has Russian cover at the UN Andrew J Tabler a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said in response to e mailed questions The struggle will now head toward civil war and outside powers will bet on various sides The current president s father encircled Hama a city known for its wooden waterwheels with tanks and artillery and then bombed residential neighborhoods known to support the Sunni Muslim rebellion As many as 10 000 people died according to estimates cited by groups including Human Rights Watch The daily death toll in Syria has exceeded 60 at least three times this year about twice the average of 34 in 2011 according to the Syrian Observatory The total figure includes women and children and many of those who died were killed and tortured by Shabeeha the Syrian term for thugs associated with the regime activists say Foreign Provocateurs The veto by Russia was its second attempt to block efforts at the UN to hold Assad accountable Syria s government has blamed terrorists and foreign provocateurs for fomenting the protests Syria was an ally of the Soviet Union receiving weapons and financial support for the Arab standoff with Israel for two decades after Hafez al Assad took over the presidency following a 1970 coup Russia still sells Syria weapons and has its only military base outside the former Soviet Union in the Syrian port of Tartus Russia s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and the head of its Foreign Intelligence Service Mikhail Fradkov travelled to Damascus today to meet Assad After the meeting Lavrov said Assad was committed to ending all violence and asked Russia to broker talks with opposition groups It s clear that the efforts to end the violence must be accompanied with the initiation of a dialogue among all political forces Lavrov said Today we received confirmation of the Syrian president s readiness to cooperate on this Russian Initiative Gulf Arab countries decided to expel Syrian ambassadors from their capitals and withdraw their own envoys from Syria The six member Gulf Cooperation Council comprising Bahrain Kuwait Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates said today it will meet next week to take decisive action Syria may have reached a point of no return Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said in an interview airing today on public television s Charlie Rose program This is an old regime using the same old tactics and it just isn t going to work said Theodore Karasik director of

"http://smittenkitchen.com/2011/04/french-onion-soup"	"10486"	"{""title"":""french onion soup smitten kitchen "",""body"":""I m firmly of the belief that no matter what ails you in the realm of the kitchen onion soup can cure it Never cooked before Don t think you ll be able to pull off the kind of cooking you believe you need to go to a restaurant to experience Start with onion soup Have only 5 to spend on dinner Refrigerator is almost bare Onion soup is your friend Want your home to have a transcendent aroma bouncing off every wall the kind that s so distracting that you don t even know or care what s on the stove only that you must have it now Onion soup is waiting for you I realize it was unfair to even make a passing reference to weepingly delicious onion soup the other day without refreshing it here I talked up once in 2006 a lifetime ago or several if you re this guy but it was a very literal recipe from Mastering the Art of French Cooking which benefits from some streamlining And yet not too much Onion soup is a remarkably simple thing to make but when simplified too liberally I ve seen recipes that instructed you to just caramelize onions for a bit add stock cheese etc the nuance that raises it to the transcendent level I ve known it to be gets lost Julia Child s original version with the very long caramelization of onions that I beg you not to skimp on because this is all the work there really is the slip of raw grated onion the cheese within and on top of the soup and starting the croutons toasted hard so they don t fall apart in the soup raises the soup beyond the everyday without making it too difficult to whip up almost any day Which I promise will happen when you realize the staggering gap between effort and outcome that Child s onion soup manages to bridge One year ago New York Cheesecake and ShakshukaTwo years ago Artichoke Olive Crostini and Chocolate Caramel Crack ers Three years ago Spring Panzanella and Lemon Yogurt Anything CakeFour years ago Artichoke Cranberry Bean and Arugula Salad and Arborio Rice Pudding Onion Soup Soupe \u00e0 l Oignon Adapted from Mastering the Art of French Cooking 1 1 2 pounds 680 grams or 24 ounces or about 5 cups thinly sliced yellow onions3 tablespoons 42 grams or 1 1 2 ounces unsalted butter1 tablespoon 15 ml olive oil1 teaspoon 5 grams table salt plus additional to taste1 4 teaspoon 1 gram granulated sugar helps the onions to brown 3 tablespoons 24 grams or 7 8 ounce all purpose flour2 quarts 8 cups or 1 9 liters beef or other brown stock 1 2 cup 118 ml dry white wine or dry white vermouthFreshly ground black pepper3 tablespoons 45 ml cognac or brandy optional To finish Gratin\u00e9e Optional 1 tablespoon grated raw onion1 to 2 cups to taste grated Swiss I often use Gruyere or a mixture of Swiss and Parmesan cheese1 tablespoon butter melted12 to 16 1 inch thick rounds French bread toasted until hard Melt the butter and oil together in the bottom of a 4 to 5 quart saucepan or Dutch oven over moderately low heat Add the onions toss to coat them in oil and cover the pot Reduce the heat to real low and let them slowly steep for 15 minutes They don t need your attention you can even go check your email After 15 minutes uncover the pot raise the heat slightly and stir in the salt and sugar Cook onions stirring frequently for 30 to 40 minutes until they have turned an even deep golden brown Don t skimp on this step as it will build the complex and intense flavor base that will carry the rest of the soup Plus from here on out it will be a cinch After the onions are fully caramelized sprinkle them with flour and cook stirring for 3 minutes Add the wine in full then stock a little at a time stirring between additions Season to taste with salt and pepper Bring to a simmer and simmer partially covered for 30 to 40 more minutes skimming if needed Correct seasonings if needed but go easy on the salt as the cheese will add a bit more saltiness and I often accidentally overdo it Stir in the cognac if using I think you should Set aside until needed I find that homemade onion soup is so deeply fragrant and flavor rich that it can stand alone but that doesn t mean we don t enjoy the graitin\u00e9ed top once in a while Here s how to pull it off Preheat oven to 325 Arrange six ovenproof soup bowls or crocks on a large foil lined baking sheet Bring the soup back to a boil and divide among six bowls To each bowl add 1 2 teaspoon grated raw onion and a tablespoon of grated cheese Stir to combine Dab your croutons with a tiny bit of butter and float a few on top of your soup bowls attempting to cover it Mound grated cheese on top of it how much you use will be up to you Julia Child in another era felt that 1 2 cup of grated cheese could be divided among 6 bowls I can assure you that if you d like your gooey bubbling cheese lid to be anything like what you get at your local French restaurant you are looking to use more such as a generous 1 4 cup Bake soups on tray for 20 minutes then preheat broiler Finish for a minute or two under the broiler to brown the top lightly Grab pot holders and serve immediately Porcini or mushroom stock are a robust vegetarian substitution

a tweeting cabbie's growing business old services meet new media: a tweeting cabbie's growing business"",""body"":""Temuri checking his Twitter and texts for new bookings Can you pick me up at my place in 15 minutes Text me when you get here No this isn t a text message to a friend or a call to a car service it s a direct message sent through Twitter to a driver of a Chicago cab Rashid Temuri who goes by Chicago Cabbie online ChicagoCabbie on Twitter has taken what would otherwise be considered a traditional taxi business and integrated it with social media in a way that is still exceedingly rare in the service industry How much better can it be interacting your clients through Twitter FourSquare Facebook or Google Latitude Apparently a lot Temuri is not only seeing success from his social media strategy he s building a loyal repeat customer base because of it Here s how Temuri works he like most other licensed cabs in the US works through a dispatching company in this case Flash Cabs Normally he would put himself on call when he s on duty meaning the company can send him to pick someone up when the client calls in But instead of doing that he has been posting when he s available on Twitter for example here s one of his recent tweets Good morning Chicago It s a wet wet day here 41 Take 5 OFF the meter from now till 2PM to any airport from anywhere ORD MDW In addition to tweeting he also allows clients or potential clients as the case may be to follow him on Google Latitude or Find My Friends so that people know wherever he is at any given time and can contact him when they need a ride He offers free WiFi within his cab for iPhone and iPad users Don t use your limited data he says and plans to soon offer free WiFi for regular laptop users Sometimes as seen in the tweet above Temuri gives discounts for his social media followers and he always remembers who everyone is Temuri s iPad and iPhone using customers get free WiFi via his Clear iSpot and he might even let you charge your phone if you ask Honestly I never looked at it as marketing nor I had that in mind when I started ChicagoCabbie account Temuri told Ars I started Twitter thinking I ll talk to people about taxi industry of Chicago I feel there is a gap between taxi drivers and customers and there are lots of misunderstandings They both are in such a defensive mode They both feel like they have to protect themselves from the other and it s just so wrong I joined Twitter to eliminate the gap between a taxi customer and taxi driver What started out as an earnest attempt to bridge the understanding gap between cabbies and clients has since flourished into a successful Internet based business one that Temuri says can sometimes be overwhelming even to an old school geek like himself Temuri told me about his days as a professional video editor adding that he has a Mac Pro at home and uses his iPhone and iPad regularly It s been working out way better then I ever expected he said In fact it has been working out so well that Temuri estimates his clientele is 90 to 95 percent repeat business something that he thinks gives him a major leg up on the competition not to mention that he s making genuine friends out of the fact that he s so easy to reach via new media methods I m loving the fact that not only will I be picking up somebody I ve met several times we sometimes start our conversation where we left off How does ChicagoCabbie s business compare with other Internet connected services namely the popular Taxi Magic app that is available for iOS Android and BlackBerry users Taxi Magic allows users to book cabs and pay with credit card directly through the app in supported cities plus it allows you to track your taxi s location there is a similar app for car services called Uber Taxi Magic is a good idea Temuri said I personally like Taxi Magic aside from the way their payment system works Temuri went on to explain that Taxi Magic charges extremely high fees to cab drivers who use it though he does acknowledge the convenience to the customer He also accepts credit cards and as mentioned earlier it s easy to track his location on one of several friend tracking services My personal service gives me advantage though he said When you call me you know who I am and who will be showing up at your door Indeed personalized service from a driver you trust or at least follow on Twitter whom you can book without picking up a phone That sounds like the kind of service you d only get from more expensive car service not a taxi cab And at least for Temuri his efforts in connecting with his customers online have paid off My goal is to change this business to the point when you get into a taxi you feel comfortable welcome and if its possible entertained either by a taxi driver who s a good conversationalist or his gadget Temuri said Traffic is just getting worse your ride doesn t have to be You shouldn t have to pay three times more to get a service like that from a car service sure, there are mobile apps for services like taxi magic and uber that can send a ride to you without you having to pick up the phone. but what if there was a cab driver you trusted, offered free wifi in his cab, and you could reach anytime through a plethora of social media services? facebook, findmyfriends, foursquare, googlelatitude,

of the World "",""body"":""Being married to appointed electives makes the first ladies reach an iconic stature Everything about them comes in the spotlight And one of the first things that get noticed is their sense of style and dressing There are those who have come and gone through the history earning no more reputation to themselves than the President s Wife or the First Lady Yet there were and are many other graceful ladies who even after becoming the First Lady had their own identity and an immaculate dressing sense for which they were hailed across the globe These women have been rightly named as the most fashionable first ladies These fashionable first ladies had their own distinct style for which they are known around the world Their fashion sense is not slave to the upcoming trends yet picks up only those elements which suit their persona and adds to their grace Fashion to them was not following a cult but making an elegant and sometimes hip hop trend of their own Their personalities were always seen in line with what they wore The most fashionable first ladies have inspired a fashion trend amongst women all around the world no matter where they belong to Where some are bold others are passive yet very elegant and timeless 1 Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Though Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was the First Lady of United States around the mid of the 20th century she is still seen as one of the greatest style icons that has ever lived In fact it is safe to say that our countdown of the most fashionable first ladies can only begin from her Throughout the time when she was the First Lady and even years after that women and fashion prodigies have always appreciated the grace and style with which she always carried herself Whether it is in the White House or barefoot in Rome she always had the perfect dressing idea Jackie wore bright and rich colours and her dresses were usually seen as monochromatic that were complemented by her signature scarf style From her very young years till now she has been a pure picture of elegance and someone who is very aware of her fashion sense 2 Michelle Obama Michelle Obama who is currently the First Lady of America is often hailed as an iconic fashionable figure She has been declared as the Best Dressed women by a number of leading fashion magazines Right after her husband became the President of United States she has taken her dressing style even more seriously than before portraying a true American female who is powerful bold and conscious about her desires and style Women all around the country and even in other places are inspired by her fun prints and bold usage of bright colours She is not afraid of trying anything from cardigans to sleeveless you will see her boldly and elegantly carrying her style making her one of the most fashionable first ladies 3 Carla Bruni Who can forget the recent France s First Lady Carla Bruni who is equally popular for being a top Italian French singer and song writer besides being one of the top fashionable First Ladies But before this much accomplished life Bruni had also been one of the top paid French models And all through this transition in her personal and professional life Carla Bruni has shown a keen sense of dressing Of course that can be owed to her extensive modelling career as well which also led her to be associated with famous fashion design houses like Chanel Versace Yves Saint Laurent Givenchy and of course Christian Dior amongst many others Although her wide ranging modelling career demanded many extreme photo shoots and modelling jobs including nude photographs Carla Bruni completely transformed after she had left her modelling profession to pursue her singing career and after she became the First Lady of France Being one of the most fashionable First ladies of the world she has truly proved that her sense of style goes beyond what is demanded by the eye of the camera Since the time Bruni took this title she has maintained a persona not much different than that of Jacqueline Kennedy sporting modest and elegant suits and dresses mostly designed by Dior a famous French label If it is not the suits and dresses she would prefer elegant long gowns in the night Although she possessed a body that many would die for Carla Bruni never gave preference to showing it off because she proved that fashion to her meant wearing the perfect cut and fabric that would praise the body rather than revealing it This clearly ascertained that Carla Bruni like Jackie Kennedy and Michelle Obama is truly one of the most fashionable First Ladies of the world who will carry this title for as long as they live the most fashionable first ladies have inspired a fashion trend amongst women all around the world, no matter where they belong to. here we take a quick look at most fashionable first ladies of the world. fashionable first ladies,fashionable ladies,most fashionable first

making thoughts work for you"",""body"":""By Bruce Campbell As someone with chronic illness you are aware of many sources of stress including the severity of your symptoms financial pressure strained relationships and uncertainty about the future This article deals with another source of stress your thoughts What we think especially our thoughts about ourselves can intensify the stress we experience from other sources In this article I ll discuss how this process works and also suggest how you can use your thoughts to reduce stress How Thoughts Create Stress To see how thoughts can create stress think what you might say to yourself when you have a setback An increase in symptoms can trigger negative thoughts like I m not getting anywhere or I ll never get better or it s hopeless Thoughts like these can actually increase your suffering because they make you feel anxious sad and hopeless which in turn makes it difficult to act in constructive ways How Thoughts Affect Mood and Action Being in a situation in which you seem to lack control can create a strong sense of helplessness But just as feelings of pessimism and despair can be learned in response to experience so can optimism To understand the connection between thoughts feelings and actions imagine the reactions of two different patients to an increase in symptoms following a short walk One says Another setback I ll never get any better The other says I walked too far today The two patients have different explanatory styles The first has a pessimistic way of interpreting experience She sees specific events as examples of permanent far reaching negative forces The other patient has a more optimistic way of seeing her experience She sees an event as something specific limited and temporary The thought I ll never get any better tends to lead to frustration depression and despair The mood of despair is associated with learned helplessness the sense of not having control the belief that effort will not be effective The thought I walked too far today is more hopeful It suggests the person can learn from experience that tomorrow need not be the same Recognizing Automatic Thoughts The process of changing explanatory style from a pessimistic helpless one to a more optimistic and hopeful one occurs in three steps The first is learning to recognize self defeating thoughts This is not easy to do because the thoughts are automatic and habitual so deeply ingrained that they seem self evident A technique for recognizing automatic thoughts is the Thought Record For a detailed explanation see the book Mind Over Mood by Dennis Greenberger and Christine Padesky Using this form offers a way to become aware of your automatic thoughts and their effects on your mood and behavior You can find similar techniques in other books such as Learned Optimism by Martin Seligman or Feeling Good by David Burns To see how this technique works we ll use an example of a patient who took a walk one day and felt very tired when she got home Feeling depressed she asked herself what thoughts were going through her mind They were I ll never get better Every time I try something it fails She wrote a description of the event in column 1 of the Thought Record See below In the second column she recorded her emotions at the time noting that she felt depressed and hopeless And in the third she wrote the thoughts going through her mind when the emotions were strongest I ll never get better Every time I try something it fails Thought Record 1 1 Event 2 Emotions 3 InitialThoughts Walked 30 min Very tired after depressed hopeless I ll never get better Everytime I try something it fails The purpose of this exercise is to help you gain some distance from your thoughts to remove their taken for granted or self evident character Often we are more harsh and judgmental toward ourselves in our inner dialogue than we would be with others Self defeating thoughts often go through our minds when something upsetting occurs Because these thoughts are automatic they can be hard to recognize and it can take some time to develop this skill Evaluating Negative Thoughts Once you have identified negative thoughts the next step is to examine them for reasonableness Ask yourself to what extent the thoughts are valid Negative thoughts tend to ignore facts or to select only the worst aspects of a situation One way to determine reasonableness is by asking What is the evidence for and against my thoughts The idea is to suspend temporarily your belief that the thoughts are true and instead look for both evidence that supports and evidence that refutes the thoughts Writing down the evidence you find helps you gain distance from your thoughts and makes them less self evident You use column 4 in the Thought Record for evidence for and column 5 for evidence against The patient in our example wrote in column 4 that she has frequent setbacks and that she had often felt worse after exercising She wrote in column 5 that she had improved over the last year and knew that many CFS patients improve Thought Record 2 1 Event 2 Emotions 3 InitialThoughts 4 Pro 5 Con Walked 30 min Very tired after depressed hopeless I ll neverget better EverytimeI trysomething it fails I have frequent setbacks Exerciseoftenmakes me worse Overall I m better than a year ago Many people recover Your thoughts at moments of strong emotion may seem irrefutable so it may help to have in mind some questions you can ask yourself in order to find evidence that does not support your thoughts Among them Do I know of situations in which the thought is not completely true all the time If someone else had this thought what would I tell them When I felt this way in the past what did I think that helped me feel better Five years from now am I likely to view this situation differently Am I blaming myself for something not under my control Seeing Alternatives In the first step you identify your self defeating thoughts by recording the thoughts associated with strong emotions In the second step you challenge the accuracy of the thoughts by testing them to find distortions and irrationalities In the last step of the process you propose a new understanding of your experience You use column 6 of the Thought Record for this purpose What you write in column 6 should be either an alternative interpretation of your experience if you refuted the thought or a balanced thought that summarizes the valid points for and against if the evidence was mixed In either case what you write should be consistent with the evidence you recorded in columns 4 and 5 Reviewing the evidence she had written in columns 4 and 5 our patient decided that the evidence was mixed She wrote a balanced thought that combined the evidence for and the evidence against I have frequent relapses but I ve made progress and that gives me hope Thought Record 3 1 Event 2 Emotions 3 InitialThoughts 4 Pro 5 Con 6 CorrectedThought Walked 30 min Very tired after depressed hopeless I ll neverget better EverytimeI trysomething it fails I have frequent setbacks Exerciseoftenmakes me worse Overall I m better than a year ago Many people recover I have frequent relapses and don t know if I ll recover but I ve made progress and now have some tools that give me hope The Goal Reduce Stress Through Realistic Thinking The process described in this article involves changing deeply ingrained habits of thought The long term results can be dramatic but improvement is gradual and there may be some bumps along the road Becoming aware of negative thoughts may produce a short term drop in mood The three step process does not involve replacing negative thoughts with positive but inaccurate thoughts I am not suggesting you adopt something like the motto Every day in every way I am getting better and better Rather the goal is to learn to see your situation in an accurate yet hopeful manner retraining your habits of thought in a more realistic direction The type of thinking integrates all evidence both positive and negative in a balanced fashion This approach should reduce your stress by helping you feel better less anxious and sad And at the same time it should help you to deal more effectively with your illness Materials on this website are not a substitute for medical care See Disclaimer You may make non commercial

stress management"",""body"":""Friday February 9 2007 09 24 PM The adrenal or stress glands are small triangular shaped glands located on the top of the kidneys Their function is to prepare the bodys resources to run or fight through the releasing of specific hormones When this primitive instinctive response is activated blood is diverted from digestive system while our blood pressure pulse blood sugar levels increase At the same time our pupils dilate and the speed of reflexes increases All of this happens as a way to ensure our survival In modern times we dont have to worry about becoming dinner for a hungry tiger or being trampled by a herd of buffalo Our bodies however automatically respond the same way when we are under physical emotional or mental stress Many of us live in a state of constant stress that strains our bodies to the point of exhaustion Over time and through repetition this can impact the way the adrenal glands function causing us to experience adrenal insufficiency or burn out If you think about it our adrenal glands can be likened to the batteries in a flashlight They are filled with a charge that is used to run the body and give us that extra edge in times of need Each time we use our flashlight we drain some of the charge from our batteries Fortunately for us our batteries are automatically recharged when we eat healthy and get lots of rest If on the other hand we use our flashlight all of the time and dont recharge our batteries regularly it is only a matter of time before the light starts to dim and eventually goes out all together Technically speaking adrenal insufficiency refers to the inability of adrenal glands to produce the proper quantity of hormones needed to run the body It should not to be confused with Addisons disease which is when the adrenal glands fail to produce hormones or shutdown completely The most common symptom of adrenal insufficiency is fatigue Other symptoms include not feeling rested after sleep inability to deal with life stressors poor memory a low sex drive frequent infections due to a suppressed immune system inability to concentrate depression mood swings irritability weight gain weakness and hormonal imbalances There are a number of reasons why people experience adrenal insufficiency It can be from a genetic or congenital abnormality but the most common one is stress Some of us force our bodies to run or fight all the time Life challenges financial pressures relationship issues and unresolved emotional concerns will eventually deplete your adrenal glands Internal stressors such as allergies physical disease nutritional deficiencies food and environmental toxins can also put pressure on the bodys natural reserves In addition stimulants such as sugar white flower caffeine as well as constant exposure to loud music loud noise or E M radiation can take a toll on our adrenal glands Recommendations For WellnessFirst and foremost stop forcing yourself to keep going and start listening to your body It will tell you what it needs If it is tired try closing your eyes and taking a few deep breaths Taking a break even a short one is a great way to let your body rest Just let it go Allow your body to let go of any resentment blame guilt worries or fears that can paralyze the adrenal glands Learning relaxation techniques such as biofeedback meditation guided imagery can help you cope with stress better Try taking a hot bath with l avender or n eroli oil at night These oils can help to calm frazzled nerves promote a feeling of calmness and bring about a restful nights sleep Siberian ginseng is an adaptogenic herb that supports the adrenal glands making it a great tonic to help the body deal with stress Found in the rainforest of South America the herb suma has been reported to help increase energy levels and rejuvenate the spirit It has been found to be useful in restoring glandular function and balancing the endocrine system Licorice Root has traditionally been used to support the adrenals This herb is very sweet and is not recommended if you are diabetic Pantothenic Acid vitamin B5 is vital for adrenal hormone production and is recommended in supporting the adrenal glands Natures Sunshines Energy V Capsules and Nervous Fatigue Formula are a collection of stimulating adaptogenic herbs which can help the body adapt to stress DHEA is a hormone precursor produced by the adrenal glands Leading health experts to believe that after the age of 25 the body s ability to produce DHEA declines and supplementation can help increase

important step toward realizing the dream of an inexpensive and simple artificial leaf a device to harness solar energy by splitting water molecules has been accomplished by two separate teams of researchers at MIT Both teams produced devices that combine a standard silicon solar cell with a catalyst developed three years ago by professor Daniel Nocera When submerged in water and exposed to sunlight the devices cause bubbles of oxygen to separate out of the water The next step to producing a full usable artificial leaf explains Nocera the Henry Dreyfus Professor of Energy and professor of chemistry will be to integrate the final ingredient an additional catalyst to bubble out the water s hydrogen atoms In the current devices hydrogen atoms are simply dissociated into the solution as loose protons and electrons If a catalyst could produce fully formed hydrogen molecules H2 the molecules could be used to generate electricity or to make fuel for vehicles Realization of that step Nocera says will be the subject of a forthcoming paper The reports by the two teams were published in the journals Energy Environmental Science on May 12 and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on June 6 Nocera encouraged two different teams to work on the project so that each could bring their special expertise to addressing the problem and says the fact that both succeeded speaks to the versatility of the catalyst system Ultimately Nocera wants to produce a low cost device that could be used where electricity is unavailable or unreliable It would consist of a glass container full of water with a solar cell with the catalysts on its two sides attached to a divider separating the container into two sections When exposed to the sun the electrified catalysts would produce two streams of bubbles hydrogen on one side oxygen on the other which could be collected in two tanks and later recombined through a fuel cell or other device to generate electricity when needed These papers are really important to show that the catalyst works when bonded to silicon to make a single device Nocera says thus enabling a unit that combines the functions of collecting sunlight and converting it to storable fuel Silicon is an Earth abundant and relatively inexpensive material that is widely used and well understood and the materials used for the catalyst cobalt and phosphorus are also abundant and inexpensive Putting it togetherMarrying the technologies of silicon solar cells with the catalyst material dubbed Co Pi for cobalt phosphate was no trivial matter explains Tonio Buonassisi the SMA Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Manufacturing who was a co author of the PNAS paper That s because the splitting of water by the catalyst creates a very aggressive chemical environment that would tend to rapidly degrade the silicon destroying the device as it operates he says In order to overcome this both teams had to find ways to protect the silicon surface while at the same time allowing it to receive the incoming sunlight and to interact with the catalyst Professor of Electrical Engineering Vladimir Bulovi\u0107 who led the other team says his team s approach was to form the Co Pi material on the surface of the silicon cell by first evaporating a layer of pure cobalt metal onto the cell electrode and then exposing it to a phosphate buffer solution under an electrical charge to transform it into the Co Pi catalyst By using the layer of Co Pi now firmly bonded to the surface we were able to passivate the surface says Elizabeth Young a postdoc who was the lead author of the E ES paper in other words it acts as a protective barrier that keeps the silicon from degrading in water Most people have been staying away from silicon for water oxidation because it forms silicon dioxide when exposed to water which is an insulator that would hinder the electrical conductivity of the material says Ronny Costi a postdoc on Bulovi\u0107 s team We had to find a way of solving that problem which they did by using the cobalt coating Buonassisi s team used a different approach coating the silicon with a protective layer We did it by putting a thin film of indium tin oxide on top explains Joep Pijpers a postdoc who was the lead author of the PNAS paper Using its expertise in the design of silicon devices that team then concentrated on matching the current output of the solar cell as closely as possible to the current consumption by the catalyzed water splitting reaction The system still needs to be optimized Pijpers says to improve the efficiency by a factor of 10 to bring it to a range comparable to conventional solar cells It s really not trivial integrating a low cost high performance silicon device with the Co Pi Buonassisi says There s a substantial amount of innovation in both device processing and architecture Both teams had to add an extra power source to the system because the voltage produced by a single junction silicon cell is not high enough to use for powering the water splitting catalyst In later versions two or three silicon solar cells will be used in series to provide the needed voltage without the need for any extra power source the researchers say One interesting aspect of these collaborations says postdoc Mark Winkler who worked with Buonassisi s team was that materials scientists and chemists had to learn to talk to each other That s trickier than it may sound he explains because the two disciplines even when talking about the same phenomena tend to use different terminology and even different ways of measuring and displaying certain characteristics Portable power Nocera s ultimate goal is to produce an artificial leaf so simple and so inexpensive that it could be made widely available to the billions of people in the world who lack access to adequate reliable sources of electricity What s needed to accomplish that in addition to stepping up the voltage is the addition of a second catalyst material to the other side of the silicon cell Nocera says Although the two approaches to bonding the catalyst with a silicon cell appear to produce functioning stable devices so far they have only been tested over periods of a few days The expectation is that they will be stable for long periods but accelerated aging tests will need to be performed to confirm this Rajeshwar Krishnan Distinguished University Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Texas at Arlington says it remains to be seen whether this self healing catalyst would hold up to several hours of current flow under rather harsh oxidative conditions But he adds that these papers certainly move the science forward The state of the science in water photo oxidation uses rather expensive noble metal oxides whereas this work uses Earth abundant low cost materials He adds that while there is still no good storage or distribution system in place for hydrogen it is likely that the solar photon to hydrogen technology will ultimately see the light of day for transportation applications with the hydrogen internal combustion engine Meanwhile Nocera has founded a company called Sun Catalytix which will initially be producing a first generation system based on the Co Pi catalyst material connected by wires to conventional separate solar cells The leaf system by contrast is still a science project Nocera says We haven t even gotten to what I would call an engineering design He hopes however that the artificial leaf could become a reality within three years Bulovi\u0107 s team was funded partly by the Chesonis Family Foundation and the National Science Foundation Buonassisi s team had support from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research NOW FOM the National Science Foundation and the Chesonis Family Foundation Nocera s work was funded by the Chesonis Family Foundation the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the National Science Foundation mit;

Originally a tropical plant it can now grow in cooler climates In Europe Hungary and Spain are the two main centres for growing paprika peppers though these varieties have evolved into much milder forms than their tropical ancestors Hungarian paprika is known as stronger and richer than Spanish paprika which is quite mild though through controlled breeding they are becoming more alike To maintain the stronger taste that consumers expect some spice companies add cayenne to heat up Hungarian paprika It is also produced and used in Turkey Yugoslavia and the United States The Spanish grades of piment\u00f3n are dolce sweet agridulce semi sweet and picante hot It is also graded for quality depending on the proportion of flesh to seeds and pith In Hungary there as six classes ranging from Kulonleges exquisite delicate to Eros hot and pungent Commercial food manufacturers use paprika in cheeses processed meats tomato sauces chili powders and soups Its main purpose is to add colour If a food item is coloured red orange or reddish brown and the label lists Natural Colour it is likely paprika Where to Buy Paprika on the InternetFor online purchases we recommend buying through one of the reputable dealers associated with Amazon using their secure online ordering system and backed by the trusted Amazon return policy Buy paprika here Spice DescriptionPaprika is a fine

milder than chilli peppers Paprika is produces from peppers ripened to redness sometimes called pimento the same as used to stuff olives The powder can vary in colour from bright red to rusty brown Bouquet slightly warm and sweetFlavour ranges from sweet and mild to pungent and fiery Hotness Scale 2 7Preparation and StoragePaprika deteriorates quickly so it should be purchased in small quantities and kept in airtight containers away from sunlight Culinary UsesPaprika is intimately associated with Hungarian cuisine especially paprikash and goulash Many spiced sausages incorporate it including the Spanish chorizos Paprika is often used as a garnish spinkled on eggs hors d ouvres and salads for colour It spices and colours cheeses and cheese spreads and is used in marinades and smoked foods It can be incorporated in the flour dusting for chicken and other meats Many Spanish Portuguese and Turkish recipes use paprika for soups stews casseroles and vegetables In India paprika is sometimes used in tandoori chicken to give the characteristic red colour Paprika is an emulsifier temporarily bonding with oil and vinegar to make a smooth mixture for a salad dressing Smoked PaprikaThe colour is a striking deep red that spreads through any dish to which it is added It has an intoxicating smoky aroma from the slow oak smoking and a silky texture from the repeated grinding between stones And because three different peppers are grown and smoked there are three different delicious flavours sweet bittersweet and hot The smoked paprika from La Vera was the world s first pepper spice to be given a Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen status in 1993 We ve tried many smoked paprikas many are excellent but we recommend the Spanish La Chinata brand They have a 3 pack of sweet bittersweet and hot You can buy smoked paprika here Use it wherever regular paprika is called for or where you want that extra depth of flavour the smoking provides Some more suggestions Put some

1 teaspoon of sweet smoked paprika and a bay leaf quickly in a little extra virgin olive oil Add a splash of wine vinegar and some chopped red onion and toss it with boiled Brussels sprouts broccoli

chicken Slowly fry waxy potatoes sliced onions and chopped garlic in olive oil and a little sweet smoked paprika season well and serve with roast lamb Rub skinned boned firm white fish fillets with a mixture of 2 tablespoons of sweet smoked paprika 1 2 teaspoon salt and the juice of a lemon dust with flour and fry in hot olive oil until golden Attributed Medicinal PropertiesFresh red peppers have more than seven times as much vitamin C as oranges but the very high heat of modern drying destroys much of the vitamin C in paprika It is however an excellent source of betacarotene that the body

Forest Cake Source Adapted from Rose Levy Beranbaum s The Cake Bible 4 ounces semisweet chocolate chopped1 2 cup boiling water4 eggs1 2 cup granulated sugar3 4 cake flour or substitute 2 1 2 tsp powdered gelatin1 3 cup water3 cup whipping cream3 tbsp granulated sugar1 1 2 tsp vanilla 1 454g can pitted bing cherries3 tbsp spiced rum 1 ounce semisweet chocolate grated or shavedPrinter Friendly Version Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and position a rack in the center Butter and flour a 9 inch spring form pan and set it aside In a small heavy sauce pan combine the chopped chocolate and water then bring it to a slow boil over low heat stirring constantly Remove it from the heat once it thickens to a pudding consistency and stirring leaves temporary lines in the surface Set it aside and let it cool to room temperature In a large bowl with an electric mixer and the whisk attachment beat the eggs and sugar until they triple in volume Gently but quickly fold in the cake flour half at a time until it s just incorporated Next fold in the cooled chocolate mixture Pour the batter into the prepared spring form pan and bake it for 25 30 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean The top of the cake will rise while baking then lower slightly when it s done and feel springy to the touch The sides will also shrink as they pull away from the pan Transfer the pan to a cooling rack and allow it to sit for 10 15 minutes before releasing the cake from the spring form to cool completely While the cake is cooling start on the Super Stabilized Whipped Cream Refrigerate a large mixing bowl and whisk attachment for at least 15 minutes Meanwhile in a small heatproof bowl combine the gelatin and water Let it soften for about 5 minutes then place the bowl in a pan of simmering water stirring occasionally until the gelatin is dissolved Set the gelatin mixture aside and let it reach room temperature before adding it to the whipped cream about 7 minutes In the chilled bowl beat the cream and sugar until traces of beater marks begin to show distinctly on the surface Add the gelatin mixture in a steady stream while beating constantly then add the vanilla and beat it further until stiff peaks form Drain the can of cherries and reserve the syrup Set aside 12 cherries to top the cake later With a cake leveller or a long serrated knife level off the top of the cooled Chocolate G\u00e9noise Cake and slice it into 2 even layers In a small bowl combine the reserved cherry syrup and spiced rum then drizzle it evenly over each cake layer Place one layer on the cake plate and wrap it snugly with a spring form pan or wax paper collar that is at least 2 1 2 inches high Reserve 2 1 4 cups of the whipped cream and spread the rest over the bottom cake layer Poke cherries into the filling then smooth it out with a knife or offset spatula Top it with the other cake layer and evenly spread about 1 cup of the reserved whipped cream Scoop the remaining whipped cream into a piping bag fitted with a large star tip and pipe 12 rosettes around the edge of the cake then press the reserved 12 cherries into the middle of each Sprinkle the top with the

without Using an Agency National Nannies how to hire a nanny without using an agency"",""body"":""10 Reasons Kids Seem to Learn the Words to Songs So Fast Posted on November 6 2012 by admin in Nannies While nanny agencies are a popular way of securing private in home childcare there are parents who would prefer to find a nanny on their own without the services of such placement agencies Fortunately for those families there are a wide variety of ways to find a nanny without the assistance of an agency From the best ways to find a nanny without agency assistance to the ins and outs of running the hiring show yourself here are a few tips to help you along the way Take Advantage of Nanny Websites Nanny agencies typically charge families a fee in exchange for placement services because the agency does the job of sifting through their pool of available childcare providers and sending over the contact information of those they feel would be the best match for the household Nanny job sites however operate on a different model generally offering prospective nanny employers access to a master list for a nominal fee While a job site designed specifically for nannies and their employers won t cull candidates that aren t likely to make the grade they do charge far less Some of these services are even free existing solely on advertising revenue Peruse Online Classified Ad Sites While online local classified ad sites like Craigslist have been on the receiving end of a bit of bad press from time to time they re still one of the more popular ways to find a nanny without using a placement service These sites allow users to post and respond to classified ads for free and are broken down into cities or regions to ensure that most respondents live locally Don t Forget About Print Taking out an ad in a local newspaper or free press publication might not be completely free but it does tend to be fairly cheap and can still net results despite the prevailing idea that print is a dying medium The trick is to choose a publication with a fairly wide readership in order to reach the highest audience Don t Underestimate the Power of Word of Mouth Ask around and you may be surprised at what you find Friends of friends that are experienced and capable career nannies or the college student studying child development who lives on the next block could turn out to be a perfect fit for your family and one that you never would have found through an agency Social media is a great way to spread the word you re looking for a nanny Never Skip the Background Check One thing that most nanny agencies do handle is the criminal background screening and driving record check that helps to ensure that you don t inadvertently hire a nanny with a documented questionable past a criminal record or a suspended license due to unsafe driving or poor decisions Because nanny job websites and online or print classified ads offer absolutely no screening of the candidates that reply it s of the utmost importance that you never choose to forgo a background check Be a Stickler for References There s nothing stopping a respondent to any advertisement from creating an entirely fictitious job history so it s imperative that you make every effort to comb through references submitted to you by promising candidates Ensuring that an applicant is who she says she is and that she actually possesses the level of education and childcare experience that she claims she does is solely your responsibility when you choose not to use a full service nanny agency Insist On Certifications CPR and first aid certifications are required by all applicants in the hiring pool of reputable nanny agencies but are not required by law for private childcare providers There s no standard licensing or certification process for nannies so it s up to you to ensure that a nanny applicant has up to date CPR certification and first aid training This ensures that she is capable of handling any emergency situations that may arise While a nanny placement agency does take a lot of the hassle and guesswork out of hiring a nanny it can also diminish the scope of your hiring power and be quite expensive Rather than being restricted to a relatively small list sent over from an agency you can cast your net wide and have a hands on hiring experience Provided that you take the proper common sense precautions are willing to invest the time and energy into screening nannies and are vigilant about checking a candidate s background and references hiring a qualified nanny

cowpeas"",""body"":""Printer Friendly Cowpeas Field Peas Stock Peas and Southern Peas are just a few names by which the legume Vigna unguiculata is known Its humble origins seem to be in northern Africa where they are widely cultivated to this day They are a food that sustains millions of people who live on the very edge of existence because it thrives in hot dry conditions I found these red cowpeas at my local Latin market I had never seen them before so naturally I picked up a couple of bags But what to do with them Most of the recipes I googled seemed rather well bland Boiled beans and rice But they are very similar to black eyed peas in both taste and texture They have the same nuttiness and are very dense in nutrition So I took my cues from my favorite recipes for black eyed peas which are usually spicy and added an African touch and used Moroccan spices Brought across the Atlantic to the Caribbean in the holds of the same ships that carried slaves destined to eat them cowpeas were introduced to America during this dark portion of our history There are records of their cultivation in Jamaica as early as 1675 There is documented consumption of these beans in Florida in 1700 and North Carolina in 1714 Cowpeas were often known as a poor man s food the landed gentry of the Eastern seaboard and early American colonies preferred the English Pea Pisum sativum and considered the cowpea simply that peas grown to feed the cows Though there is no evidence that he ate them himself but George Washington imported 40 bushels of what he called pease from Jamaica in 1797 to plant in his fields So it does seem likely he used them as food for both slaves and livestock Though he seems to have shunned these beans himself he would probably be shocked to learn that his cattle slaves and sharecroppers were enjoying a much more nutritious diet than he It was not the only nutritional mistake made by Mr Washington either He was convinced that the tomato was poisonous and unfit for humans But this did not stop his slaves or his poorer but healthier neighbors from adding both crops to their diets Cowpeas consist of an average of 24 protein they are rich in the amino acids lysine and tryptophan and are most nutritious when eaten in combination with grains The Southern custom of serving peas with cornbread rice or biscuits is a tradition that is actually healthy This makes them an ideal food for vegetarians and people who limit their meat intake When the cowpea reached the southern United States it was a perfect marriage of plant climate and economic conditions Southern farmers embraced the pea enthusiastically and through the years many varieties were developed Each with colorful names like Clay Red Ripper Calico Rattlesnake Whippoorwill Rouge et Noire Mississippi Silver and Texas Cream The variety I found are red and more closely related to its African ancestors than many of these varieties known in the south Nelson Mandela famously described cowpeas in his book Long Walk to Freedom For this reason they have gained cultural significance in Africa and remain staple to millions there It may not be easy to find African red cowpeas like I used in this recipe but black eyed peas are a closely related variety and could easily be substituted My version is stewed and has North African flavors It makes a great one dish meal on a cold or rainy day They can be served over rice as in the southern tradition of peas and rice But with a bit more broth they make a great soup too Cowpeas cook a bit faster than most beans so watch them closely Most recipes I saw said to soak the beans but I found that unnecessary and liked the meatier texture that came from cooking them with out a pre soak Moroccan Stewed Cow Peas with Kale serves 8 CLICK here for a printable recipe Rinse the beans well Drain and set aside Heat the oil in a large heavy bottomed dutch oven set over medium heat Add the onions and garlic and cook stirring often until the onions soften and the garlic is fragrant Add the beans stirring to coat and cook an additional 2 minutes Add the cumin paprika ginger cayenne cinnamon stick star anise and tomatoes with their liquid and enough water to cover the beans by about 1 inch Bring the beans to a simmer add 2 or 3 teaspoons salt then lower the heat and cook covered stirring occasionally until the beans are softened somewhat and most of the liquid is mostly absorbed about 45 minutes to 1 hour Watch the liquid level carefully and add more water if needed Add enough chicken stock to cover the beans by about 1 inch or more if you prefer to serve this as a soup Bring the mixture to a boil lower heat and simmer until the beans are tender but not mushy About 15 minutes Remove the cinnamon stick and star anise Add the kale stirring to incorporate until it is just wilted Adjust seasoning and serve with sour cream or crumbled feta cheese optional cowpeas are highly nutritional but they did not always get the kind of respect they deserve, hence the unflattering name. mine are moroccan spiced and deliciously easy to prepare.
