shows Syrian President Bashar al Assad standing next to a portrait of his late father Hafez al Assad in Damascus Photographer Louai Bashara AFP Getty Images Syrian President Bashar al Assad has turned to his father s playbook as he seeks to end an uprising that threatens his family s 40 year reign The government s increasing brutality is reminiscent of 1982 when Hafez al Assad crushed a rebellion in the city of Hama killing thousands Assad is using tanks and artillery in cities where protesters are calling for the end of his rule At least 174 people were killed on Feb 4 said the U K based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights making it one of the deadliest days in the 11 month revolt Assad turned the barrels of his guns on his people in Syria just like his father Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan a former ally of the Syrian leader said in televised comments today We told you to show the public that you re different than your father Bashar you reap what you sow President Barack Obama also drew attention to the parallel last week Diplomatic efforts to stem the bloodshed broke down Feb 4 when Russia and China vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution by western and Arab countries to facilitate a political transition The prospect of civil war is growing as Al Arabiya reported defecting Syrian army units are taking tanks with them Dead End Street Obama has dismissed the idea of using a foreign military force to end the conflict that the UN estimates has already killed more than 5 400 people Syrian forces yesterday killed 98 people in the central city of Homs continuing an assault that started last weekend Al Jazeera reported citing activists The nationwide toll yesterday was 128 Al Jazeera said It s very important for us to resolve this without recourse to outside military intervention and I think that s possible Obama said yesterday on NBC s Today program Turkey is using all diplomatic channels to work with the international community and initiate new measures to stand by the Syrian opposition and stop Assad s deadly crackdown Erdogan said I m calling on Assad to remind him one more time that he is traveling down a dead end street Images aired by Al Arabiya yesterday showed civilians in Homs fleeing as gunfire echoed through empty streets and smoldering buildings damaged by shelling The army also shelled Idlib in the north and Zabadani near the Lebanese border The Syrian Free Army a group of soldiers who defected to the opposition will stage a retaliatory counter attack in the province of Homs Aref al Hmoud a leader of the force told BBC s Arabic television service by telephone from Hatay Turkey Father s Playbook Assad is returning to his father s playbook because he still has Russian cover at the UN Andrew J Tabler a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said in response to e mailed questions The struggle will now head toward civil war and outside powers will bet on various sides The current president s father encircled Hama a city known for its wooden waterwheels with tanks and artillery and then bombed residential neighborhoods known to support the Sunni Muslim rebellion As many as 10 000 people died according to estimates cited by groups including Human Rights Watch The daily death toll in Syria has exceeded 60 at least three times this year about twice the average of 34 in 2011 according to the Syrian Observatory The total figure includes women and children and many of those who died were killed and tortured by Shabeeha the Syrian term for thugs associated with the regime activists say Foreign Provocateurs The veto by Russia was its second attempt to block efforts at the UN to hold Assad accountable Syria s government has blamed terrorists and foreign provocateurs for fomenting the protests Syria was an ally of the Soviet Union receiving weapons and financial support for the Arab standoff with Israel for two decades after Hafez al Assad took over the presidency following a 1970 coup Russia still sells Syria weapons and has its only military base outside the former Soviet Union in the Syrian port of Tartus Russia s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and the head of its Foreign Intelligence Service Mikhail Fradkov travelled to Damascus today to meet Assad After the meeting Lavrov said Assad was committed to ending all violence and asked Russia to broker talks with opposition groups It s clear that the efforts to end the violence must be accompanied with the initiation of a dialogue among all political forces Lavrov said Today we received confirmation of the Syrian president s readiness to cooperate on this Russian Initiative Gulf Arab countries decided to expel Syrian ambassadors from their capitals and withdraw their own envoys from Syria The six member Gulf Cooperation Council comprising Bahrain Kuwait Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates said today it will meet next week to take decisive action Syria may have reached a point of no return Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said in an interview airing today on public television s Charlie Rose program This is an old regime using the same old tactics and it just isn t going to work said Theodore Karasik director of research at the Dubai based Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis They think they can get away with it and I don

       "  u'{title:How Loud Snoring is Related to Silent Strokes ,body:Snoring is an unpleasant feature of life for most people But snoring can be much more than a minor irritation It can also be a sign of a deadly medical condition For some over 18 million Americans snoring is related to obstructive sleep apnea OSA People who suffer from OSA repeatedly and unknowingly stop breathing during the night due to a complete or partial obstruction of their airway It occurs when the jaw throat and tongue muscles relax blocking the airway used to breathe The resulting lack of oxygen can last for a minute or longer and occur hundreds of times each night Most people wake when a complete or partial obstruction occurs but it can leave you feeling completely exhausted Sleep apnea is already known to be related to a raft of health problems including frequent nighttime urination memory loss depression diabetes and heart attack Now a new study links sleep apnea to so called silent strokes in which there is tissue death in the brain without symptoms Sleep apnea had already been shown to be a risk factor for stroke in numerous small studies but a new study conducted at the University of Technology in Dresden Germany has linked sleep apnea with the milder silent strokes Part of the research involved performing brain imaging studies of people with sleep apnea Those with the condition were more likely to have the silent strokes as evidenced on the brain scans the researchers found Having more than five episodes a night was linked with having silent strokes The higher the severity of the apnea the more likely these silent strokes were found on brain imaging OSA can be expensive to diagnosis and treat and is not always covered by insurance A sleep clinic will require an overnight visit up to 5 000 Doctors then analyze the data and prescribe one of several treatments These may suggest that you to wear uncomfortable CPAP devices that force air through your nose and mouth while you sleep to keep your airways open and may even include painful surgery Is there a better option Fortunately though there is now a far less costly uncomfortable and invasive treatment option now available A recent case study published by Eastern Virginia Medical School s Division of Sleep Medicine in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine concludes that wearing a simple chinstrap while you sleep can be an effective treatment for OSA The chin strap which is now available from a company called MySnoringSolution works by supporting the lower jaw and tongue preventing obstruction of the airway It s made from a high tech lightweight and super comfortable material Thousands of people have used the MySnoringSolution chinstrap to help relieve their snoring symptoms and they report better sleeping and better health overall because of it An effective snoring solution for just 119The My Snoring Solution Chinstrap is available exclusively from the company s website which is currently offering a limited time 2 for 1 offer The product also comes with a 100 percent satisfaction guarantee If you want to stop snoring once and for all without expensive CPAP devices or other intrusive devices this may be the solution you ve been waiting for The free additional strap is great for travel or as a gift for a fellow sufferer And the product comes with an unconditional 90 day money back guarantee Click here to learn more about this special 119 offer from MySnoringSolution The statements and claims made about this product have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration U S This product is not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent disease if you\\\\u2019re like most americans you probably don\\\\u2019t get eight hours sleep each night. but, if you also constantly feel ...,url:howlifeworks a a AG ID 1186 cid 7340ci}',\n",

       "  u'{title:french onion soup smitten kitchen ,body:I m firmly of the belief that no matter what ails you in the realm of the kitchen onion soup can cure it Never cooked before Don t think you ll be able to pull off the kind of cooking you believe you need to go to a restaurant to experience Start with onion soup Have only 5 to spend on dinner Refrigerator is almost bare Onion soup is your friend Want your home to have a transcendent aroma bouncing off every wall the kind that s so distracting that you don t even know or care what s on the stove only that you must have it now Onion soup is waiting for you I realize it was unfair to even make a passing reference to weepingly delicious onion soup the other day without refreshing it here I talked up once in 2006 a lifetime ago or several if you re this guy but it was a very literal recipe from Mastering the Art of French Cooking which benefits from some streamlining And yet not too much Onion soup is a remarkably simple thing to make but when simplified too liberally I ve seen recipes that instructed you to just caramelize onions for a bit add stock cheese etc the nuance that raises it to the transcendent level I ve known it to be gets lost Julia Child s original version with the very long caramelization of onions that I beg you not to skimp on because this is all the work there really is the slip of raw grated onion the cheese within and on top of the soup and starting the croutons toasted hard so they don t fall apart in the soup raises the soup beyond the everyday without making it too difficult to whip up almost any day Which I promise will happen when you realize the staggering gap between effort and outcome that Child s onion soup manages to bridge One year ago New York Cheesecake and ShakshukaTwo years ago Artichoke Olive Crostini and Chocolate Caramel Crack ers Three years ago Spring Panzanella and Lemon Yogurt Anything CakeFour years ago Artichoke Cranberry Bean and Arugula Salad and Arborio Rice Pudding Onion Soup Soupe \\\\u00e0 l Oignon Adapted from Mastering the Art of French Cooking 1 1 2 pounds 680 grams or 24 ounces or about 5 cups thinly sliced yellow onions3 tablespoons 42 grams or 1 1 2 ounces unsalted butter1 tablespoon 15 ml olive oil1 teaspoon 5 grams table salt plus additional to taste1 4 teaspoon 1 gram granulated sugar helps the onions to brown 3 tablespoons 24 grams or 7 8 ounce all purpose flour2 quarts 8 cups or 1 9 liters beef or other brown stock 1 2 cup 118 ml dry white wine or dry white vermouthFreshly ground black pepper3 tablespoons 45 ml cognac or brandy optional To finish Gratin\\\\u00e9e Optional 1 tablespoon grated raw onion1 to 2 cups to taste grated Swiss I often use Gruyere or a mixture of Swiss and Parmesan cheese1 tablespoon butter melted12 to 16 1 inch thick rounds French bread toasted until hard Melt the butter and oil together in the bottom of a 4 to 5 quart saucepan or Dutch oven over moderately low heat Add the onions toss to coat them in oil and cover the pot Reduce the heat to real low and let them slowly steep for 15 minutes They don t need your attention you can even go check your email After 15 minutes uncover the pot raise the heat slightly and stir in the salt and sugar Cook onions stirring frequently for 30 to 40 minutes until they have turned an even deep golden brown Don t skimp on this step as it will build the complex and intense flavor base that will carry the rest of the soup Plus from here on out it will be a cinch After the onions are fully caramelized sprinkle them with flour and cook stirring for 3 minutes Add the wine in full then stock a little at a time stirring between additions Season to taste with salt and pepper Bring to a simmer and simmer partially covered for 30 to 40 more minutes skimming if needed Correct seasonings if needed but go easy on the salt as the cheese will add a bit more saltiness and I often accidentally overdo it Stir in the cognac if using I think you should Set aside until needed I find that homemade onion soup is so deeply fragrant and flavor rich that it can stand alone but that doesn t mean we don t enjoy the graitin\\\\u00e9ed top once in a while Here s how to pull it off Preheat oven to 325 Arrange six ovenproof soup bowls or crocks on a large foil lined baking sheet Bring the soup back to a boil and divide among six bowls To each bowl add 1 2 teaspoon grated raw onion and a tablespoon of grated cheese Stir to combine Dab your croutons with a tiny bit of butter and float a few on top of your soup bowls attempting to cover it Mound grated cheese on top of it how much you use will be up to you Julia Child in another era felt that 1 2 cup of grated cheese could be divided among 6 bowls I can assure you that if you d like your gooey bubbling cheese lid to be anything like what you get at your local French restaurant you are looking to use more such as a generous 1 4 cup Bake soups on tray for 20 minutes then preheat broiler Finish for a minute or two under the broiler to brown the top lightly Grab pot holders and serve immediately Porcini or mushroom stock are a robust vegetarian substitution See more Budget French Photo Soup Do more Link

beans or peppers Red pepper flakes take broccoli zucchini and spinach to the next level Or try adding chili sauce to any of your favorite veggie dishes your tastebuds will wake right up 3 Go Beyond Potatoes There are more ways to enjoy creamy side dishes other than the mashed potato Cauliflower beans and peas can all have a similar effect To make it even easier use frozen vegetables Toss them in boiling water for a few minutes then throw them in a blender or food processor to create a silky smooth mixture Add olive oil garlic or cheese for extra flavor You might even forget all about that old

an even tastier treat pair it with creamy avocado or a simple spread like hummus It s healthy finger food on the go 6 Garden Fresh Flavor Fresh herbs make everything taste like it s right from the garden Try classic combinations like tomatoes and basil or potatoes and chives Or get creative with pairings such as mint and peas or cilantro and peppers When in doubt fresh parsley will liven up almost any vegetable dish 7 Be Bold Try cooking your favorite veggies in new ways Saut\\\\u00e9 greens to bring out their flavor Steam veggies to soften them slightly Roast peppers or tomatoes for a sweet effect Grill corn or onions for a delicious charred flavor Or Bake fennel or leeks for a tender result You might discover new things from your old favorites 8 Keep it interesting Don t be afraid

checking his Twitter and texts for new bookings Can you pick me up at my place in 15 minutes Text me when you get here No this isn t a text message to a friend or a call to a car service it s a direct message sent through Twitter to a driver of a Chicago cab Rashid Temuri who goes by Chicago Cabbie online ChicagoCabbie on Twitter has taken what would otherwise be considered a traditional taxi business and integrated it with social media in a way that is still exceedingly rare in the service industry How much better can it be interacting your clients through Twitter FourSquare Facebook or Google Latitude Apparently a lot Temuri is not only seeing success from his social media strategy he s building a loyal repeat customer base because of it Here s how Temuri works he like most other licensed cabs in the US works through a dispatching company in this case Flash Cabs Normally he would put himself on call when he s on duty meaning the company can send him to pick someone up when the client calls in But instead of doing that he has been posting when he s available on Twitter for example here s one of his recent tweets Good morning Chicago It s a wet wet day here 41 Take 5 OFF the meter from now till 2PM to any airport from anywhere ORD MDW In addition to tweeting he also allows clients or potential clients as the case may be to follow him on Google Latitude or Find My Friends so that people know wherever he is at any given time and can contact him when they need a ride He offers free WiFi within his cab for iPhone and iPad users Don t use your limited data he says and plans to soon offer free WiFi for regular laptop users Sometimes as seen in the tweet above Temuri gives discounts for his social media followers and he always remembers who everyone is Temuri s iPad and iPhone using customers get free WiFi via his Clear iSpot and he might even let you charge your phone if you ask Honestly I never looked at it as marketing nor I had that in mind when I started ChicagoCabbie account Temuri told Ars I started Twitter thinking I ll talk to people about taxi industry of Chicago I feel there is a gap between taxi drivers and customers and there are lots of misunderstandings They both are in such a defensive mode They both feel like they have to protect themselves from the other and it s just so wrong I joined Twitter to eliminate the gap between a taxi customer and taxi driver What started out as an earnest attempt to bridge the understanding gap between cabbies and clients has since flourished into a successful Internet based business one that Temuri says can sometimes be overwhelming even to an old school geek like himself Temuri told me about his days as a professional video editor adding that he has a Mac Pro at home and uses his iPhone and iPad regularly It s been working out way better then I ever expected he said In fact it has been working out so well that Temuri estimates his clientele is 90 to 95 percent repeat business something that he thinks gives him a major leg up on the competition not to mention that he s making genuine friends out of the fact that he s so easy to reach via new media methods I m loving the fact that not only will I be picking up somebody I ve met several times we sometimes start our conversation where we left off How does ChicagoCabbie s business compare with other Internet connected services namely the popular Taxi Magic app that is available for iOS Android and BlackBerry users Taxi Magic allows users to book cabs and pay with credit card directly through the app in supported cities plus it allows you to track your taxi s location there is a similar app for car services called Uber Taxi Magic is a good idea Temuri said I personally like Taxi Magic aside from the way their payment system works Temuri went on to explain that Taxi Magic charges extremely high fees to cab drivers who use it though he does acknowledge the convenience to the customer He also accepts credit cards and as mentioned earlier it s easy to track his location on one of several friend tracking services My personal service gives me advantage though he said When you call me you know who I am and who will be showing up at your door Indeed personalized service from a driver you trust or at least follow on Twitter whom you can book without picking up a phone That sounds like the kind of service you d only get from more expensive car service not a taxi cab And at least for Temuri his efforts in connecting with his customers online have paid off My goal is to change this business to the point when you get into a taxi you feel comfortable welcome and if its possible entertained either by a taxi driver who s a good conversationalist or his gadget Temuri said Traffic is just getting worse your ride doesn t have to be You shouldn t have to pay three times more to get a service like that from a car service sure, there are mobile apps for services like taxi magic and uber that can send a ride to you without you having to pick up the phone. but what if there was a cab driver you trusted, offered free wifi in his cab, and you could reach anytime through a plethora of social media services? facebook, findmyfriends, foursquare, googlelatitude, socialmedia, taxi, twitter,url:arstechnica gadgets news 2012 01 old services meet new media a tweeting cabbies growing business

       "  u'{url:utmostarray most fashionable first ladies of the world html,title:Most Fashionable First Ladies of the World ,body:Being married to appointed electives makes the first ladies reach an iconic stature Everything about them comes in the spotlight And one of the first things that get noticed is their sense of style and dressing There are those who have come and gone through the history earning no more reputation to themselves than the President s Wife or the First Lady Yet there were and are many other graceful ladies who even after becoming the First Lady had their own identity and an immaculate dressing sense for which they were hailed across the globe These women have been rightly named as the most fashionable first ladies These fashionable first ladies had their own distinct style for which they are known around the world Their fashion sense is not slave to the upcoming trends yet picks up only those elements which suit their persona and adds to their grace Fashion to them was not following a cult but making an elegant and sometimes hip hop trend of their own Their personalities were always seen in line with what they wore The most fashionable first ladies have inspired a fashion trend amongst women all around the world no matter where they belong to Where some are bold others are passive yet very elegant and timeless 1 Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Though Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was the First Lady of United States around the mid of the 20th century she is still seen as one of the greatest style icons that has ever lived In fact it is safe to say that our countdown of the most fashionable first ladies can only begin from her Throughout the time when she was the First Lady and even years after that women and fashion prodigies have always appreciated the grace and style with which she always carried herself Whether it is in the White House or barefoot in Rome she always had the perfect dressing idea Jackie wore bright and rich colours and her dresses were usually seen as monochromatic that were complemented by her signature scarf style From her very young years till now she has been a pure picture of elegance and someone who is very aware of her fashion sense 2 Michelle Obama Michelle Obama who is currently the First Lady of America is often hailed as an iconic fashionable figure She has been declared as the Best Dressed women by a number of leading fashion magazines Right after her husband became the President of United States she has taken her dressing style even more seriously than before portraying a true American female who is powerful bold and conscious about her desires and style Women all around the country and even in other places are inspired by her fun prints and bold usage of bright colours She is not afraid of trying anything from cardigans to sleeveless you will see her boldly and elegantly carrying her style making her one of the most fashionable first ladies 3 Carla Bruni Who can forget the recent France s First Lady Carla Bruni who is equally popular for being a top Italian French singer and song writer besides being one of the top fashionable First Ladies But before this much accomplished life Bruni had also been one of the top paid French models And all through this transition in her personal and professional life Carla Bruni has shown a keen sense of dressing Of course that can be owed to her extensive modelling career as well which also led her to be associated with famous fashion design houses like Chanel Versace Yves Saint Laurent Givenchy and of course Christian Dior amongst many others Although her wide ranging modelling career demanded many extreme photo shoots and modelling jobs including nude photographs Carla Bruni completely transformed after she had left her modelling profession to pursue her singing career and after she became the First Lady of France Being one of the most fashionable First ladies of the world she has truly proved that her sense of style goes beyond what is demanded by the eye of the camera Since the time Bruni took this title she has maintained a persona not much different than that of Jacqueline Kennedy sporting modest and elegant suits and dresses mostly designed by Dior a famous French label If it is not the suits and dresses she would prefer elegant long gowns in the night Although she possessed a body that many would die for Carla Bruni never gave preference to showing it off because she proved that fashion to her meant wearing the perfect cut and fabric that would praise the body rather than revealing it This clearly ascertained that Carla Bruni like Jackie Kennedy and Michelle Obama is truly one of the most fashionable First Ladies of the world who will carry this title for as long as they live the most fashionable first ladies have inspired a fashion trend amongst women all around the world, no matter where they belong to. here we take a quick look at most fashionable first ladies of the world.

       "  u'{title:Taming Stressful Thoughts Making Thoughts Work For You taming stressful thoughts: making thoughts work for you,body:By Bruce Campbell As someone with chronic illness you are aware of many sources of stress including the severity of your symptoms financial pressure strained relationships and uncertainty about the future This article deals with another source of stress your thoughts What we think especially our thoughts about ourselves can intensify the stress we experience from other sources In this article I ll discuss how this process works and also suggest how you can use your thoughts to reduce stress How Thoughts Create Stress To see how thoughts can create stress think what you might say to yourself when you have a setback An increase in symptoms can trigger negative thoughts like I m not getting anywhere or I ll never get better or it s hopeless Thoughts like these can actually increase your suffering because they make you feel anxious sad and hopeless which in turn makes it difficult to act in constructive ways How Thoughts Affect Mood and Action Being in a situation in which you seem to lack control can create a strong sense of helplessness But just as feelings of pessimism and despair can be learned in response to experience so can optimism To understand the connection between thoughts feelings and actions imagine the reactions of two different patients to an increase in symptoms following a short walk One says Another setback I ll never get any better The other says I walked too far today The two patients have different explanatory styles The first has a pessimistic way of interpreting experience She sees specific events as examples of permanent far reaching negative forces The other patient has a more optimistic way of seeing her experience She sees an event as something specific limited and temporary The thought I ll never get any better tends to lead to frustration depression and despair The mood of despair is associated with learned helplessness the sense of not having control the belief that effort will not be effective The thought I walked too far today is more hopeful It suggests the person can learn from experience that tomorrow need not be the same Recognizing Automatic Thoughts The process of changing explanatory style from a pessimistic helpless one to a more optimistic and hopeful one occurs in three steps The first is learning to recognize self defeating thoughts This is not easy to do because the thoughts are automatic and habitual so deeply ingrained that they seem self evident A technique for recognizing automatic thoughts is the Thought Record For a detailed explanation see the book Mind Over Mood by Dennis Greenberger and Christine Padesky Using this form offers a way to become aware of your automatic thoughts and their effects on your mood and behavior You can find similar techniques in other books such as Learned Optimism by Martin Seligman or Feeling Good by David Burns To see how this technique works we ll use an example of a patient who took a walk one day and felt very tired when she got home Feeling depressed she asked herself what thoughts were going through her mind They were I ll never get better Every time I try something it fails She wrote a description of the event in column 1 of the Thought Record See below In the second column she recorded her emotions at the time noting that she felt depressed and hopeless And in the third she wrote the thoughts going through her mind when the emotions were strongest I ll never get better Every time I try something it fails Thought Record 1 1 Event 2 Emotions 3 InitialThoughts Walked 30 min Very tired after depressed hopeless I ll never get better Everytime I try something it fails The purpose of this exercise is to help you gain some distance from your thoughts to remove their taken for granted or self evident character Often we are more harsh and judgmental toward ourselves in our inner dialogue than we would be with others Self defeating thoughts often go through our minds when something upsetting occurs Because these thoughts are automatic they can be hard to recognize and it can take some time to develop this skill Evaluating Negative Thoughts Once you have identified negative thoughts the next step is to examine them for reasonableness Ask yourself to what extent the thoughts are valid Negative thoughts tend to ignore facts or to select only the worst aspects of a situation One way to determine reasonableness is by asking What is the evidence for and against my thoughts The idea is to suspend temporarily your belief that the thoughts are true and instead look for both evidence that supports and evidence that refutes the thoughts Writing down the evidence you find helps you gain distance from your thoughts and makes them less self evident You use column 4 in the Thought Record for evidence for and column 5 for evidence against The patient in our example wrote in column 4 that she has frequent setbacks and that she had often felt worse after exercising She wrote in column 5 that she had improved over the last year and knew that many CFS patients improve Thought Record 2 1 Event 2 Emotions 3 InitialThoughts 4 Pro 5 Con Walked 30 min Very tired after depressed hopeless I ll neverget better EverytimeI trysomething it fails I have frequent setbacks Exerciseoftenmakes me worse Overall I m better than a year ago Many people recover Your thoughts at moments of strong emotion may seem irrefutable so it may help to have in mind some questions you can ask yourself in order to find evidence that does not support your thoughts Among them Do I know of situations in which the thought is not completely true all the time If someone else had this thought what would I tell them When I felt this way in the past what did I think that helped me feel better Five years from now am I likely to view this situation differently Am I blaming myself for something not under my control Seeing Alternatives In the first step you identify your self defeating thoughts by recording the thoughts associated with strong emotions In the second step you challenge the accuracy of the thoughts by testing them to find distortions and irrationalities In the last step of the process you propose a new understanding of your experience You use column 6 of the Thought Record for this purpose What you write in column 6 should be either an alternative interpretation of your experience if you refuted the thought or a balanced thought that summarizes the valid points for and against if the evidence was mixed In either case what you write should be consistent with the evidence you recorded in columns 4 and 5 Reviewing the evidence she had written in columns 4 and 5 our patient decided that the evidence was mixed She wrote a balanced thought that combined the evidence for and the evidence against I have frequent relapses but I ve made progress and that gives me hope Thought Record 3 1 Event 2 Emotions 3 InitialThoughts 4 Pro 5 Con 6 CorrectedThought Walked 30 min Very tired after depressed hopeless I ll neverget better EverytimeI trysomething it fails I have frequent setbacks Exerciseoftenmakes me worse Overall I m better than a year ago Many people recover I have frequent relapses and don t know if I ll recover but I ve made progress and now have some tools that give me hope The Goal Reduce Stress Through Realistic Thinking The process described in this article involves changing deeply ingrained habits of thought The long term results can be dramatic but improvement is gradual and there may be some bumps along the road Becoming aware of negative thoughts may produce a short term drop in mood The three step process does not involve replacing negative thoughts with positive but inaccurate thoughts I am not suggesting you adopt something like the motto Every day in every way I am getting better and better Rather the goal is to learn to see your situation in an accurate yet hopeful manner retraining your habits of thought in a more realistic direction The type of thinking integrates all evidence both positive and negative in a balanced fashion This approach should reduce your stress by helping you feel better less anxious and sad And at the same time it should help you to deal more effectively with your illness Materials

       "  u'{title:Heart Hands Home Homemade Mozzarella Cheese ,body:Mozzarella is one of the easiest cheeses to make it only takes 30 minutes and the taste can t be beat The ingredients are simple although a couple of them you may have to search a bit for but the end result is worth it especially when you can say I made it myself Homemade Mozzarella Cheese1 gallon whole milk just be sure that it is not Ultra pasteurized any other kind will work store bought fresh from the cow or goat 1 tsp citric acid 1 4 rennet tablet 2 tsp cheese salt A big potThermometerSlotted spoon please ignore the mess in the background we still haven t finished putting things back together after our wall project Place milk in large pot with thermometer Sprinkle 1 tsp citric acid over milk and stir Turn heat on med low and heat milk to 90 degrees stirring occasionally While you are heating the milk dissolve 1 4 rennet tablet in 1 4 C cool water When milk has reached 90 degrees turn off heat Pour rennet over slotted spoon into milk and stir for 20 30 seconds Remove thermometer and let milk sit undisturbed for 8 10 minutes Milk should be like a thick gelatin Cut the curd into a grid pattern Stir gently for a minute and then remove the curd using your slotted spoon into a microwave safe bowl trying to leave as much of the whey the yellowish liquid behind Pour off as much liquid as you can without losing any curds Heat in microwave for 1 minute Stir pour off liquid and heat for 35 40 seconds more Stir and pour off any liquid Cheese should start to stick together and look stringy If the curds are not sticking together you can heat for 35 40 seconds more Once your curds are sticking together and you have removed most of the liquid add your cheese salt I usually sprinkle a little on knead and sprinkle more on until all the salt is incorporated After your salt is incorporated heat the cheese for 35 45 seconds more until it is stretchy like taffy The cheese will be really hot so it helps to wear gloves to work with the cheese Pull and stretch cheese until it is shiny and smooth Shape cheese into a log by kneading on counter top Place cheese into a bowl of ice water for about 5 minutes to firm it up One gallon of milk will yield about 1 pound of cheese I paid 2 39 for the milk so 1 pound of fresh mozzarella was less than 2 50 Now the fun part deciding how to use your homemade cheese Citric acid rennet and cheese salt can often be found at local beer and wine supply stores or in some specialty grocery stores If you cannot find it locally you can order it online from New England Cheese Supply The first couple of times I made my own cheese I was sure I was doing it wrong but I am always amazed that at some point it all seems to come together and I have cheese so don t get discouraged I discovered the brand of milk I used can really make a difference in the finished product so if the first batch doesn t work out try a different brand I will be sharing some recipes next week that highlight your homemade cheese ,url:heart hands home blogspot 2011 01 homemade mozzarella cheese html}',\n",

       "  u'{title:Red White and Blueberry Lemon Cupcakes Pinch My Salt ,body:I can t remember the last time I made cupcakes It s just not really my thing It s not that I dislike them I mean what s not to like They re cute they re easy they re made of cake and they re covered in frosting No wonder so many people decided in the last few years that cupcakes should no longer be strictly relegated to school birthday parties The cupcake craze has been sweeping the nation for quite some time now and the fact that I haven t dedicated at least one blog post to this trendy treat shows how decidedly unhip I am like I really had to point that out But whatever My friends Jon and Julie just had the cutest baby on the planet and when Julie sleep deprived and recovering from an emergency C section repeatedly mentioned that she would love to taste the Lemon Scented Blueberry Cupcakes that she saw in her Cooking Light magazine I decided that maybe it was time for me to finally join the cool kids and bake some cupcakes The recipe was the grand prize winner in the second annual Cooking Light Ultimate Reader Recipe Contest Cooking Light has some great recipes but I usually don t make light desserts I don t substitute splenda for sugar and I never use any of the strange reduced calorie butter substitutes fat free sour creams or cream cheeses I like to create healthy recipes but I always use real ingredients and I ve always felt that at my house dessert needs to be a real dessert To me dessert is a special treat and since it s not something I eat all the time I don t feel the need to try to lighten up my favorite desserts If I feel that I need to cut back I d rather go without dessert than eat something that tastes like diet food But this cupcake recipe uses real butter and sugar just not in excessive amounts I can deal with that I would call these little treats cupcakes only because of the frosting If the frosting was left off they would easily pass as muffins In fact I think I ll try these sometime with whole wheat flour leave the frosting off and eat them as breakfast muffins That being said the frosting is what makes these one of the best desserts I ve had in a while I love any kind of cream cheese frosting but this tart and tangy lemon frosting was one of the best I ve tasted It was a little on the runny side but it worked fine As I was eating it with a spoon I had visions of all the other cakes and cookies I could frost with this stuff The only problem I had with this recipe is that my cupcakes were flat Well maybe concave is a better description They didn t look like the cute rounded cupcakes that I saw in the magazine photo But they looked fine with a dollop of frosting on top and with my limited cupcake making experience I don t really know if the cupcakes are even supposed to be rounded on top All in all this was an easy dessert recipe that tasted great The blueberry and lemon flavors go together perfectly the cake is moist with just the right amount of sweetness and the tart sweet frosting is to die for If you re a cake snob you might be offended by the muffin like texture of these cupcakes But if that s the case maybe you need to lighten up You can find the recipe for Lemon Scented Blueberry Cupcakes here Related Recipes Around the Web Now I d like to share a photo of Cayla Madison the cutest newborn I ve ever seen who inspired me to bake the cupcakes in the first place Happy Fourth of July everyone enjoy the fireworks ,url:pinchmysalt 2007 07 04 red white and blueberry lemon cupcakes}',\n",

       "  u\"{title:Stress Management Fighting Burn out Natural Help For Stress Fatigue and Adrenal Insufficiency stress management,body:Friday February 9 2007 09 24 PM The adrenal or stress glands are small triangular shaped glands located on the top of the kidneys Their function is to prepare the bodys resources to run or fight through the releasing of specific hormones When this primitive instinctive response is activated blood is diverted from digestive system while our blood pressure pulse blood sugar levels increase At the same time our pupils dilate and the speed of reflexes increases All of this happens as a way to ensure our survival In modern times we dont have to worry about becoming dinner for a hungry tiger or being trampled by a herd of buffalo Our bodies however automatically respond the same way when we are under physical emotional or mental stress Many of us live in a state of constant stress that strains our bodies to the point of exhaustion Over time and through repetition this can impact the way the adrenal glands function causing us to experience adrenal insufficiency or burn out If you think about it our adrenal glands can be likened to the batteries in a flashlight They are filled with a charge that is used to run the body and give us that extra edge in times of need Each time we use our flashlight we drain some of the charge from our batteries Fortunately for us our batteries are automatically recharged when we eat healthy and get lots of rest If on the other hand we use our flashlight all of the time and dont recharge our batteries regularly it is only a matter of time before the light starts to dim and eventually goes out all together Technically speaking adrenal insufficiency refers to the inability of adrenal glands to produce the proper quantity of hormones needed to run the body It should not to be confused with Addisons disease which is when the adrenal glands fail to produce hormones or shutdown completely The most common symptom of adrenal insufficiency is fatigue Other symptoms include not feeling rested after sleep inability to deal with life stressors poor memory a low sex drive frequent infections due to a suppressed immune system inability to concentrate depression mood swings irritability weight gain weakness and hormonal imbalances There are a number of reasons why people experience adrenal insufficiency It can be from a genetic or congenital abnormality but the most common one is stress Some of us force our bodies to run or fight all the time Life challenges financial pressures relationship issues and unresolved emotional concerns will eventually deplete your adrenal glands Internal stressors such as allergies physical disease nutritional deficiencies food and environmental toxins can also put pressure on the bodys natural reserves In addition stimulants such as sugar white flower caffeine as well as constant exposure to loud music loud noise or E M radiation can take a toll on our adrenal glands Recommendations For WellnessFirst and foremost stop forcing yourself to keep going and start listening to your body It will tell you what it needs If it is tired try closing your eyes and taking a few deep breaths Taking a break even a short one is a great way to let your body rest Just let it go Allow your body to let go of any resentment blame guilt worries or fears that can paralyze the adrenal glands Learning relaxation techniques such as biofeedback meditation guided imagery can help you cope with stress better Try taking a hot bath with l avender or n eroli oil at night These oils can help to calm frazzled nerves promote a feeling of calmness and bring about a restful nights sleep Siberian ginseng is an adaptogenic herb that supports the adrenal glands making it a great tonic to help the body deal with stress Found in the rainforest of South America the herb suma has been reported to help increase energy levels and rejuvenate the spirit It has been found to be useful in restoring glandular function and balancing the endocrine system Licorice Root has traditionally been used to support the adrenals This herb is very sweet and is not recommended if you are diabetic Pantothenic Acid vitamin B5 is vital for adrenal hormone production and is recommended in supporting the adrenal glands Natures Sunshines Energy V Capsules and Nervous Fatigue Formula are a collection of stimulating adaptogenic herbs which can help the body adapt to stress DHEA is a hormone precursor produced by the adrenal glands Leading health experts to believe that after the age of 25 the body s ability to produce DHEA declines and supplementation can help increase energy and counteract the effects of stress Supplements made from bovine adrenal glands provide

artificial leaf a device to harness solar energy by splitting water molecules has been accomplished by two separate teams of researchers at MIT Both teams produced devices that combine a standard silicon solar cell with a catalyst developed three years ago by professor Daniel Nocera When submerged in water and exposed to sunlight the devices cause bubbles of oxygen to separate out of the water The next step to producing a full usable artificial leaf explains Nocera the Henry Dreyfus Professor of Energy and professor of chemistry will be to integrate the final ingredient an additional catalyst to bubble out the water s hydrogen atoms In the current devices hydrogen atoms are simply dissociated into the solution as loose protons and electrons If a catalyst could produce fully formed hydrogen molecules H2 the molecules could be used to generate electricity or to make fuel for vehicles Realization of that step Nocera says will be the subject of a forthcoming paper The reports by the two teams were published in the journals Energy Environmental Science on May 12 and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on June 6 Nocera encouraged two different teams to work on the project so that each could bring their special expertise to addressing the problem and says the fact that both succeeded speaks to the versatility of the catalyst system Ultimately Nocera wants to produce a low cost device that could be used where electricity is unavailable or unreliable It would consist of a glass container full of water with a solar cell with the catalysts on its two sides attached to a divider separating the container into two sections When exposed to the sun the electrified catalysts would produce two streams of bubbles hydrogen on one side oxygen on the other which could be collected in two tanks and later recombined through a fuel cell or other device to generate electricity when needed These papers are really important to show that the catalyst works when bonded to silicon to make a single device Nocera says thus enabling a unit that combines the functions of collecting sunlight and converting it to storable fuel Silicon is an Earth abundant and relatively inexpensive material that is widely used and well understood and the materials used for the catalyst cobalt and phosphorus are also abundant and inexpensive Putting it togetherMarrying the technologies of silicon solar cells with the catalyst material dubbed Co Pi for cobalt phosphate was no trivial matter explains Tonio Buonassisi the SMA Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Manufacturing who was a co author of the PNAS paper That s because the splitting of water by the catalyst creates a very aggressive chemical environment that would tend to rapidly degrade the silicon destroying the device as it operates he says In order to overcome this both teams had to find ways to protect the silicon surface while at the same time allowing it to receive the incoming sunlight and to interact with the catalyst Professor of Electrical Engineering Vladimir Bulovi\\\\u0107 who led the other team says his team s approach was to form the Co Pi material on the surface of the silicon cell by first evaporating a layer of pure cobalt metal onto the cell electrode and then exposing it to a phosphate buffer solution under an electrical charge to transform it into the Co Pi catalyst By using the layer of Co Pi now firmly bonded to the surface we were able to passivate the surface says Elizabeth Young a postdoc who was the lead author of the E ES paper in other words it acts as a protective barrier that keeps the silicon from degrading in water Most people have been staying away from silicon for water oxidation because it forms silicon dioxide when exposed to water which is an insulator that would hinder the electrical conductivity of the material says Ronny Costi a postdoc on Bulovi\\\\u0107 s team We had to find a way of solving that problem which they did by using the cobalt coating Buonassisi s team used a different approach coating the silicon with a protective layer We did it by putting a thin film of indium tin oxide on top explains Joep Pijpers a postdoc who was the lead author of the PNAS paper Using its expertise in the design of silicon devices that team then concentrated on matching the current output of the solar cell as closely as possible to the current consumption by the catalyzed water splitting reaction The system still needs to be optimized Pijpers says to improve the efficiency by a factor of 10 to bring it to a range comparable to conventional solar cells It s really not trivial integrating a low cost high performance silicon device with the Co Pi Buonassisi says There s a substantial amount of innovation in both device processing and architecture Both teams had to add an extra power source to the system because the voltage produced by a single junction silicon cell is not high enough to use for powering the water splitting catalyst In later versions two or three silicon solar cells will be used in series to provide the needed voltage without the need for any extra power source the researchers say One interesting aspect of these collaborations says postdoc Mark Winkler who worked with Buonassisi s team was that materials scientists and chemists had to learn to talk to each other That s trickier than it may sound he explains because the two disciplines even when talking about the same phenomena tend to use different terminology and even different ways of measuring and displaying certain characteristics Portable power Nocera s ultimate goal is to produce an artificial leaf so simple and so inexpensive that it could be made widely available to the billions of people in the world who lack access to adequate reliable sources of electricity What s needed to accomplish that in addition to stepping up the voltage is the addition of a second catalyst material to the other side of the silicon cell Nocera says Although the two approaches to bonding the catalyst with a silicon cell appear to produce functioning stable devices so far they have only been tested over periods of a few days The expectation is that they will be stable for long periods but accelerated aging tests will need to be performed to confirm this Rajeshwar Krishnan Distinguished University Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Texas at Arlington says it remains to be seen whether this self healing catalyst would hold up to several hours of current flow under rather harsh oxidative conditions But he adds that these papers certainly move the science forward The state of the science in water photo oxidation uses rather expensive noble metal oxides whereas this work uses Earth abundant low cost materials He adds that while there is still no good storage or distribution system in place for hydrogen it is likely that the solar photon to hydrogen technology will ultimately see the light of day for transportation applications with the hydrogen internal combustion engine Meanwhile Nocera has founded a company called Sun Catalytix which will initially be producing a first generation system based on the Co Pi catalyst material connected by wires to conventional separate solar cells The leaf system by contrast is still a science project Nocera says We haven t even gotten to what I would call an engineering design He hopes however that the artificial leaf could become a reality within three years Bulovi\\\\u0107 s team was funded partly by the Chesonis Family Foundation and the National Science Foundation Buonassisi s team had support from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research NOW FOM the National Science Foundation and the

integral to my very existence Like my iPhone If I couldn t check my Twitter every hour you might find me shaking in a corner somewhere in a cold sweat Or if I just couldn t play Tap Tap Revenge I d probably start obsessively drumming three fingers on every and any surface I could get my rhythm deprived hands on My camera Being a self professed shutter bug I snap photos of lots of pretty things edible or otherwise If it broke or got stolen one day I d probably cry Like ugly face desperate air gasping cry My laptop I ve filled this baby to the brim with photos music and videos When people aren t looking I stroke it and whisper sweet nothings into its air vents One of these days we re going to have a disagreement regarding the location of some very important files and I want to put that off for as long as possible My hair straightener Without it my hair get s poofy and I will not walk through life with poofy hair I just won t I refuse Burt s Bees pomegranate rosemary lip balm I can t stand lipstick and it makes kissing my fella far too complicated This lip balm makes my lips just slightly redder and smooth plus it s pretty much all natural which is nice My fella of course You saw that coming right Who else would laugh at my bad puns warm up my feet when they re cold or eat the bits of leftover cake I levelled off the top Chocolate Cherries Whipped cream Lucky for me this cake

the prepared spring form pan and bake it for 25 30 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean The top of the cake will rise while baking then lower slightly when it s done and feel springy to the touch The sides will also shrink as they pull away from the pan Transfer the pan to a cooling rack and allow it to sit for 10 15 minutes before releasing the cake from the spring

would prefer to find a nanny on their own without the services of such placement agencies Fortunately for those families there are a wide variety of ways to find a nanny without the assistance of an agency From the best ways to find a nanny without agency assistance to the ins and outs of running the hiring show yourself here are a few tips to help you along the way Take Advantage of Nanny Websites Nanny agencies typically charge families a fee in exchange for placement services because the agency does the job of sifting through their pool of available childcare providers and sending over the contact information of those they feel would be the best match for the household Nanny job sites however operate on a different model generally offering prospective nanny employers access to a master list for a nominal fee While a job site designed specifically for nannies and their employers won t cull candidates that aren t likely to make the grade they do charge far less Some of these services are even free existing solely on advertising revenue Peruse Online Classified Ad Sites While online local classified ad sites like Craigslist have been on the receiving end of a bit of bad press from time to time they re still one of the more popular ways to find a nanny without using a placement service These sites allow users to post and respond to classified ads for free and are broken down into cities or regions to ensure that most respondents live locally Don t Forget About Print Taking out an ad in a local newspaper or free press publication might not be completely free but it does tend to be fairly cheap and can still net results despite the prevailing idea that print is a dying medium The trick is to choose a publication with a fairly wide readership in order to reach the highest audience Don t Underestimate the Power of Word of Mouth Ask around and you may be surprised at what you find Friends of friends that are experienced and capable career nannies or the college student studying child development who lives on the next block could turn out to be a perfect fit for your family and one that you never would have found through an agency Social media is a great way to spread the word you re looking for a nanny Never Skip the Background Check One thing that most nanny agencies do handle is the criminal background screening and driving record check that helps to ensure that you don t inadvertently hire a nanny with a documented questionable past a criminal record or a suspended license due to unsafe driving or poor decisions Because nanny job websites and online or print classified ads offer absolutely no screening of the candidates that reply it s of the utmost importance that you never choose to forgo a background check Be a Stickler for References There s nothing stopping a respondent to any advertisement from creating an entirely fictitious job history so it s imperative that you make every effort to comb through references submitted to you by promising candidates Ensuring that an applicant is who she says she is and that she actually possesses the level of education and childcare experience that she claims she does is solely your responsibility when you choose not to use a full service nanny agency Insist On Certifications CPR and first aid certifications are required by all applicants in the hiring pool of reputable nanny agencies but are not required by law for private childcare providers There s no standard licensing or certification process for nannies so it s up to you to ensure that a nanny applicant has up to date CPR certification and first aid training This ensures that she is capable of handling any emergency situations that may arise While a nanny placement agency does take a lot of the hassle and guesswork out of hiring a nanny it can also diminish the scope of your hiring power and be quite expensive Rather than being restricted to a relatively small list sent over from an agency you can cast your net wide and have a hands on hiring experience Provided that you take the proper common sense precautions are willing to invest the time and energy into screening nannies and are vigilant about checking a candidate s background and references hiring a qualified nanny without the services of an agency is possible 10 Reasons Kids Seem to Learn the Words to Songs So Fast DIY

of the 6 3 billion running shoe business one of the biggest and most visible areas of sporting goods with 11 percent growth in 2011 according to industry analyst SportsOneSource Nearly all sneakers have a sole that looks like lasagna composed of layers of rubber foam and plastic The fluffy foam is made from ethylene vinyl acetate or EVA which has its critics EVA adds weight to shoes and lab tests show it requires more energy per stride Running shoe companies have long sought an EVA substitute that absorbs shock but also returns more energy Consumers like the cushioned feeling associated with a conventional running shoe says Darren Stefanyshyn a University of Calgary researcher and former chairperson of the Footwear Biomechanics Group If you could provide that without using foam you d

       "  u'{title:Italian Lasagna with meat ,body:My FIL absolutely loves my lasagna I wish that I could take credit for putting it together but that would be a lie many years ago I had followed the recipe on the back of the Creamette lasagna box and was sold However each time I wanted to make it I just looked on the back of the box always throwing the one away before it Well one day I was in the grocery store picking up the noodles I looked on the back of the box I always bought the groceries I needed from the recipe as well and it had VEGETABLE lasagna on the back WHAT Oh no I checked almost every box on the grocery store shelf but alas no Italian Lasagna recipe ACK So I hoped and prayed that I still had a box in the cabinet I was lucky there was still half a box of noodles on my shelf at home so I immediately cut the recipe off the box and taped it to a piece of paper it s tattered it s splattered but it s tried and true and holds a special place in my recipe binder And now I will share that lost recipe with you as I think it s the best recipe around And speaking of best recipes over at My Lasagna Recipe there s a post called No 1 Best Lasagna Recipe and I was very pleased to see that their recipe is almost identical to mine Theirs contains nutmeg which I ve never tried but maybe next time I make it I ll give theirs a whirl I will say that I tried their noodle soaking method rather than boiling them and it made a world of difference so I thank them for that But for now I think this is the best lasagna recipe ever Italian Lasagna1 2 of a 1 pound package lasagna uncooked1 lb bulk Italian sausage1 2 lb ground beef1 cup chopped onion2 cloves garlic minced1 28 oz can tomatoes cut up undrained 2 6 oz cans tomato paste2 tsp sugar2 tsp salt1 1 2 tsp basil leaves1 2 tsp fennel seed1 4 tsp pepper1 15 oz container ricotta cheese1 egg beaten1 tbsp parsley flakes1 2 tsp salt1 cup sliced pitted ripe olives I omit this I hate olives LOL 4 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese3 4 cup grated parmasan cheesePrepare lasagna according to package directions drain I didn t do this last night and it was much better Instead I filled a baking pan with hot water and put the noodles in After making the meat mixture I drained the water and added more hot water They were softer but not cooked they finished cooking during the baking process Much easier to cut the finished product In large skillet combine Italian sausage ground beef onion and garlic Cook until sausage is no longer pink and onion is tender drain Stir in next 7 ingredients Bring to boil Reduce heat simmer 20 minutes In medium bowl blend ricotta egg parsley and salt Spoon 1 1 2 cups of meat sauce into 13 x 9 inch baking dish Layer one third each lasagna remaining meat sauce ricotta mixture mozzarella cheese and parmesan cheese Repeat layers Cover Bake in 375 degree F oven for 25 minutes Uncover bake until hot about 20 minutes longer Let stand 10 minutes before cutting 8 10 servings When I cooked mine last night the cheese wasn t browned enough for me so I placed it under the broiler for just a few minutes O MANGA Did you enjoy this post Why not subscribe to my feed or better yet to my free newsletter Foodie in the Craftroom which provides not only recipes but crafts from my other blog Crafts by Amanda too ,url:amandascookin 2008 09 italian lasagna with meat html}',\n",

       "  u'{title:An African Bean Finds Its Way to America Cowpeas an african bean finds its way to america- cowpeas,body:Printer Friendly Cowpeas Field Peas Stock Peas and Southern Peas are just a few names by which the legume Vigna unguiculata is known Its humble origins seem to be in northern Africa where they are widely cultivated to this day They are a food that sustains millions of people who live on the very edge of existence because it thrives in hot dry conditions I found these red cowpeas at my local Latin market I had never seen them before so naturally I picked up a couple of bags But what to do with them Most of the recipes I googled seemed rather well bland Boiled beans and rice But they are very similar to black eyed peas in both taste and texture They have the same nuttiness and are very dense in nutrition So I took my cues from my favorite recipes for black eyed peas which are usually spicy and added an African touch and used Moroccan spices Brought across the Atlantic to the Caribbean in the holds of the same ships that carried slaves destined to eat them cowpeas were introduced to America during this dark portion of our history There are records of their cultivation in Jamaica as early as 1675 There is documented consumption of these beans in Florida in 1700 and North Carolina in 1714 Cowpeas were often known as a poor man s food the landed gentry of the Eastern seaboard and early American colonies preferred the English Pea Pisum sativum and considered the cowpea simply that peas grown to feed the cows Though there is no evidence that he ate them himself but George Washington imported 40 bushels of what he called pease from Jamaica in 1797 to plant in his fields So it does seem likely he used them as food for both slaves and livestock Though he seems to have shunned these beans himself he would probably be shocked to learn that his cattle slaves and sharecroppers were enjoying a much more nutritious diet than he It was not the only nutritional mistake made by Mr Washington either He was convinced that the tomato was poisonous and unfit for humans But this did not stop his slaves or his poorer but healthier neighbors from adding both crops to their diets Cowpeas consist of an average of 24 protein they are rich in the amino acids lysine and tryptophan and are most nutritious when eaten in combination with grains The Southern custom of serving peas with cornbread rice or biscuits is a tradition that is actually healthy This makes them an ideal food for vegetarians and people who limit their meat intake When the cowpea reached the southern United States it was a perfect marriage of plant climate and economic conditions Southern farmers embraced the pea enthusiastically and through the years many varieties were developed Each with colorful names like Clay Red Ripper Calico Rattlesnake Whippoorwill Rouge et Noire Mississippi Silver and Texas Cream The variety I found are red and more closely related to its African ancestors than many of these varieties known in the south Nelson Mandela famously described cowpeas in his book Long Walk to Freedom For this reason they have gained cultural significance in Africa and remain staple to millions there It may not be easy to find African red cowpeas like I used in this recipe but black eyed peas are a closely related variety and could easily be substituted My version is stewed and has North African flavors It makes a great one dish meal on a cold or rainy day They can be served over rice as in the southern tradition of peas and rice But with a bit more broth they make a great soup too Cowpeas cook a bit faster than most beans so watch them closely Most recipes I saw said to soak the beans but I found that unnecessary and liked the meatier texture that came from cooking them with out a pre soak Moroccan Stewed Cow Peas with Kale serves 8 CLICK here for a printable recipe Rinse the beans well Drain and set aside Heat the oil in a large heavy bottomed dutch oven set over medium heat Add the onions and garlic and cook stirring often until the onions soften and the garlic is fragrant Add the beans stirring to coat and cook an additional 2 minutes Add the cumin paprika ginger cayenne cinnamon stick star anise and tomatoes with their liquid and enough water to cover the beans by about 1 inch Bring the beans to a simmer add 2 or 3 teaspoons salt then lower the heat and cook covered stirring occasionally until the beans are softened somewhat and most of the liquid is mostly absorbed about 45 minutes to 1 hour Watch the liquid level carefully and add more water if needed Add enough chicken stock to cover the beans by about 1 inch or more if you prefer to serve this as a soup Bring the mixture to a boil lower heat and simmer until the beans are tender but not mushy About 15 minutes Remove the cinnamon stick and star anise Add the kale stirring to incorporate until it is just wilted Adjust seasoning and serve with sour cream or crumbled feta cheese optional cowpeas are highly nutritional but they did not always get the kind of respect they deserve, hence the unflattering name. mine are moroccan spiced and

       "  u'{title:11 Overdramatic Road Warning Signs Ranked By Overdramaticness ,body:In a delicious coincidence my friend and longtime creative collaborator Paul with whom I started PandaSmash com worked at Break com wrote and produced a play wrote a screenplay and more got a book deal around the same time I got mine And our books came out within a month of each other His book is called States of Confusion and details the 48 day 48 state solo road trip he went on after finishing college Therefore when we discussed him doing a guest 11 Points we focused it on travel During his drive he took photos of some of the more ridiculous signs he saw And since I have a history of loving ridiculous signs my 11 Businesses Selling Two Hilariously Unconnected Items still warms my heart I jumped when he suggested using some of his sign photos for this list So here are 11 overdramatic road warning signs ranked from least to most overdramatic Paul took some of these on his trip and found some others thanks to the magic of the Internet As is the standard 11 Points guest list style I ve tossed in a few comments on these as well Enjoy Work Zone Let Em Live Paul I took this picture in South Carolina where construction areas seem to be less minor inconveniences and more opportunities to wantonly run down municipal workers Sam I know the implication is that you ll slow down to let the workers live but are the expectations of us SO low that the government thinks we ll recklessly plow over people if we aren t reminded not to That would be like me putting up a sign right now about avoiding run on sentences Crazy swerving looms Paul I guess this is a sign for a slippery road or possibly drunk drivers but really the phrase getting my swerve on is what sticks in mind most Sam I think that car is doing the criss cross moment from the Casper Cha Cha Slide Part two I believe Bike ejections forthcoming Paul I m not sure if this was posted above trolley car tracks some kind of Oregon Trail esque wagon rut path or just a really terrible road Whatever it is crossing it via bicycle will really own you Sam This is why I never ride my bike on Lincoln Logs You Can Die Paul As much as it may be a little over the top one has to admire this sign for its blunt honesty It IS your decision after all Sam But sometimes you have to risk your life and ski the K12 The only way to truly defeat a bully is to beat him in a skiing race Splatter Zone Paul The first of our beware of animals series this obviously is not an American sign Unless it s in the hippo fallout section of the San Diego Zoo It does remind me of some of the signs in Africa right next to the ones warning you that the blue assed monkeys will tear your ears off Sam When I was growing up there was actually a place called the Splatter Zone where kids would paint ceramic molds And fittingly a lot of us would add brown splatter paint to the back end of the animals Now that s an avalanche Paul CAUTION Driving in this area leaves you vulnerable to avalanches falling cows and driving a 67 Studebaker Sam What if this sign was just accidentally posted 90 degrees wrong If you give it one turn clockwise it s like someone s flying a flag over the ocean while a cow goes for a swim The world s meanest moose Paul The moose in this area will not only wreck the hell out of your car but then stare you down for being a little bitch Sam If a moose charges at me straight from the gates of hell I don t think I d need a sign to tell me to pay ATTENTION Hang on tight Paul What s scarier than the on the nose Don t feed your baby daughter to the alligator thing is that I m not sure that s an alligator Perhaps Don t feed your daughter to the eyeless remorseless toothy Death Monster Either way nightmares Sam Plus years down the road this opens your daughter up completely to being fooled by Peter Pan and an alarm clock Isn t semi permanently an oxymoron Paul A sign with so much going on that I don t even know where to start Semi permanently Deactivated A snow mobile Was there an earthquake I think if this is the condition your road is in the sign should just read Road Closed Sam This is why I would never pay a sign manufacturer by the letter And why I d provide by own clip art Time to reinforce the pier Paul Indeed DO NOT do this Sam I don t have the greatest graphic design skills in the world but I certainly wouldn t have let this one go to the printer with all of the action happening in front of the red circle with the line through it I know it would ve blocked most of the action to have the layers in the proper stacking order but that s a fundamental design flaw Which leads me to believe the people who were responsible for the sign were also responsible for the structural integrity of the pier Someone cut the brakes Paul Another animal one but how could I not It s not enough that there s a handicapped person slipping down an incline there also has to be an alligator And speed lines Sam It s either a sign for the world s most dangerous place to take your handicapped family member or one pointing fans in the direction of the most extreme Special Olympics event ever Check out Paul s book States of Confusion on Amazon And also if you haven t gotten my book yet please note that the two of them add up to just a few cents over the 25 free shipping plateau It s fate man ,url:11points

       "  u'{url:cracked article 18392 6 reasons homemade porn worse idea than you think html,title:6 Reasons Homemade Porn is a Worse Idea Than You Think 6 reasons homemade porn is a worse idea than you think 6 reasons homemade porn is a worse idea than you think,body:So you just watched Chyna s muscular pocky heiny get befouled by a greasy little man and you re pretty confident that you could wrangle up an inebriated girl with five kids and low self esteem who might want to make a movie too That s awesome I ve pondered it too but any time I bring the idea up it s generally met with revulsion Apparently Internet comedy CHUDs just aren t made for film But the idea is still a good one right Thanks to a string of C list celebrities and low budget websites the idea of a home sex tape is now more reasonable than ever Who would turn down a chance to hump on camera Not me Not you Not anyone But let this be a warning to you Some things do not belong on camera For some reason real porn makes us want to make amateur porn But look at amateur porn Look at Screech for God s sake Like a malnourished shaven orangutan he brings nothing to the table In real porn actors and actresses are chosen from the finest broken homes in the Midwest and given top of the line plastic surgery and full body make up Have you ever heard of asshole bleaching Porn stars do that A porn star is so dedicated to their job that when given some constructive criticism on set like Hey Starla I noticed your anus is looking a bit on the dingy side maybe look into that they make a mental note to visit the ass bleaching salon later in the day and have a stranger apply some manner of pigment reducing spackle to their crapper Right on the hole While their asses look like sparkling puckers of sanitation and delight fashioned from the finest alabaster and stank mine looks like the Sarlacc that ate Boba Fett It has no business on camera and chances are yours will be just as atrocious You could always bend over in front of a mirror and try to gauge where yours stands but you ll probably need at least one other present for a comparison In the end you ll probably just depress yourself Other areas you may want to reconsider showing on camera include the underside of your sack the front of your sack any parts of you covered in hair and the back of your head if you have one of those weird skin folds You know those things It s like a dinner roll of head flesh Just off putting that is 5 Porn Sex isn t Real Sex The thing about porn sex is that it s designed specifically to be filmed Like have you ever noticed how often dudes get into the most horribly uncomfortable looking positions That s to accommodate a sweaty man with a large camera who wants to perform an unlicensed colonoscopy or some other manner of internal review with a fish eye lens So we re given a wide array of shots and angles that necessitate the performers humping around corners and engaging in visually stunning but horribly unfulfilling maneuvers True story Back in aught 6 I was inspired after viewing some adult cinema to try sex standing up Like the kind where you just pick the woman right up and hold her there like some kind of bag of hump potatoes What was I thinking I work at a computer all day my whole body has atrophied to pudding To this day my back has not healed and there s still a dent in the drywall from my head Porn inspires you to do stupid sex Sex that doesn t really feel good but we re convinced is awesome because porn stars seem to love it But you could give a porn star 20 and a sandwich and she d fake an orgasm over Weetabix And it d be wild too She d call Weetabix a whore and tell it to spank her Wish I had some Weetabix You break out the camera and you think you re going to capture unchained passion but really you re probably just going to catch your goodie bag jiggling like a cat toy made from bologna 4 You Have Poor Equipment Some people like amateur porn because of its grittiness which is like enjoying authentic Central American water for the dysentery Porn has to have some quality for it to be good Real porn is on a sound stage or at least some dude s backyard there s lighting and sound equipment and the camera probably didn t come from the Wal Mart electronics department Have you ever been in a public restroom when an overweight man in a hurry comes in And you re forced to take the next stall and just sit in silent horror and listen as he tries to both get comfortable and stave off an aneurysm Why is there is much heavy breathing And squishing And then wet plops That s what homemade porn sounds like Lighting is one of the most underappreciated aspects of filmmaking If not for lighting those pristine fake boobies that make legit porn so enthralling would look like the decrepit peaks of Mordor But they don t do they No sir they look delightful But under your Simpsons novelty lamp they and your ass are going to look flatter than piss on a plate and marred with creeping black shadows thanks to a string of c-list celebrities and low budget websites, the idea of a home sex tape is now more reasonable than ever. who would turn down a chance to hump on camera? not me. not you. not anyone. but let this be a warning to you, some things do not belong on camera.}',\n",

       "  u'{title:Heading Out on Your Own Day 21 Know Your Way Around a Kitchen heading out on your own &#8212; day 21: know your way around a kitchen,body:If there remains a lingering sense among older generations of men that cooking is women s work I would think it is probably fading greatly among the younger set True for much of human history men did the hunting farming and women did the cooking and this arrangement continued to work well into the 20th century Young men made a quick transition from living with their flapjack flipping mother to settling down with a meatloaf making wife Or he lodged at boarding houses that provided victuals along with a bed But those days are long gone accommodations that come with a cook are now virtually non existent although it lives on in fraternity houses and men are remaining bachelors longer well into their late 20s and early 30s As all modern men still need to eat virtually every single day the only choice that remains is either starving or being completely dependent on restaurant meals and take out food Maturing into a grown man means becoming self sufficient so daily dependence isn t an option Further not only does learning to cook help you become more independent it offers other benefits as well Keeps you healthy and strong When you cook for yourself you know and control exactly what you put in your mouth Almost anything you make for yourself even the same dish served at a restaurant will have less salt fat calories and additives than the commercially made variety Saves you money Sure it is possible to eat cheaply by ordering all your food off the dollar menu but while fast food won t clip your wallet it will take a toll on your health which will cost you big bucks down the line When it comes to making real wholesome food cooking at home is generally cheaper than eating out Impresses the ladies As a young man you re going to be dating and nothing impresses a gal like a man who can invite her back to his place for a home cooked meal Gives you enjoyment No I don t always enjoy cooking But when you have time and are in the right mood it can be very satisfying to create something tasty for you and for your friends family Now I m not a home cooking zealot Sometimes the way I feel about cooking can be summed up in this comic from The Oatmeal it can seem like it is more hassle than it s worth and when you re super busy and stressed the convenience of take out is a lifesaver The key is striking a balance and you can t do that if you can t cook anything beyond toast and ramen The good news here is that while gourmet chef ery takes a lot of training and practice simple cooking can be learned by anyone who knows how to read So in this post we cover many of the basics a young man who s never cooked for himself needs to know to get started First we ll talk about how to stock your kitchen with equipment and your pantry with staple items Then we ll talk about a few basic skills and bits of know how you need to learn in order to cook edible hopefully delicious food Finally because you don t need to amass the kitchen equipment listed below all at once we ll talk about some things you can cook when your options and tools are limited Let s get started Stocking Your Kitchen Essential Equipment For this section I had AoM s food writer Matt Moore give us the lowdown on how to outfit your kitchen Here s what he had to say For me it s always about quality over quantity Instead of investing in specialty garlic presses zesters or other gimmicks just give me a killer knife that ll do all those jobs and not get lost in my junk drawer Less is always more For that reason I ve put together my list of essential kitchen equipment needed for every guy You don t need to go out immediately and stock your kitchen with everything listed here You can acquire this stuff over time Be resourceful and check yard sales flea markets or online outlets that offer these items at great deals Meanwhile improvise and make the most of what you have Hardware Pots Pans Baking Dishes 1 Small 2 5 qt Pot with Lid terrific for making sauces steaming veggies or heating liquids 1 Large 6 qt Pot with Lid perfect for boiling pasta or potatoes 9 13 Pyrex Baking Dish a must have for baking or roasting 12 Inch Cast Iron Skillet cast iron cookware is inexpensive and will last a lifetime On top of that it cooks evenly retains heat and is also believed to keep you healthy by supplying a steady dose of iron to your diet For more tips on use and care check out my post from last month 12 Inch Non Stick Skillet with Glass Lid the non stick surface makes cleanup quick and easy Dutch Oven Style Pot with Lid enameled cast iron is the best option however any pot with a heavy bottom will do the trick Great for making soups and braising meats Grill Pan a fantastic substitute for a grill I prefer cast iron grill pans over the non stick versions Non Stick Baking Sheet super cheap and probably one of my most utilized items in the kitchen Tools and Accessories For the Utility Drawer 8 Inch Chef s Knife with a Sharpening Steel a chef s best friend Don t go cheap here Can Opener I prefer the manual ones still never figured out the electronic versions Box Cheese Grater I like these because it provides several different options in one a slicer a rough grate a fine grate and an extra fine grate for harder cheeses Choose one with a large base to provide more stability Food Processor Blender the workhorse of the kitchen Great for saving time and creating specialized dishes Pepper Mill indispensable for any kitchen Fresh cracked pepper is worth the extra effort and this tool makes it easy to always have it on hand Measuring Cups and Spoons these will be absolutely necessary to make sure you are getting the right measurements when following recipes Pot Holder Oven Mitt because I don t know anyone who likes to burn themselves A folded towel will also work Spatula my preference is stainless steel slotted spatulas Tongs great for when you need a more precise touch Vegetable Peeler fantastic for peeling fresh vegetables or shaving cheeses Wine Opener I prefer the ones that also have a bottle opener A drill drywall screw and pliers will do the trick if you find yourself in a bind Trust me Potato Ricer Masher a ricer is a great tool for making silky smooth mashed potatoes A masher is an even cheaper and more versatile tool that will provide a more rustic consistency Digital Meat Thermometer a useful tool to make sure your meat is always perfectly cooked Cutting Board I prefer a large wood cutting board over any other surface Make sure it has a solid footing so as not to slide while cutting Whisks extremely versatile fantastic for making vinaigrettes dressings or even a roux Wooden Spoon heatproof and durable I like having these in several different sizes Colander a must have for draining washing straining or rinsing Serving Storage Items For the Cupboards Flatware Assorted Serving Plates or Platters Assorted Mixing Serving Bowls Storage Containers Storage Bags Plastic Wrap Aluminum Foil Wax Parchment Paper Thanks Matt Now let s take a look at stocking your pantry Stocking Your Pantry The Essentials These are the things that will come in handy for a variety of recipes or a spontaneous meal idea and are always good to have on hand All purpose flour Baking powder Baking soda Brown sugar Honey Oats Sauces Soy sauce BBQ sauce hot sauce etc Cornstarch Peanut butter White sugar Olive oil Cans of beans Diced tomatoes tomato paste tomato sauce Herbs and spices salt pepper Italian Mexican seasonings crushed red pepper garlic powder onion powder curry powder chili powder basil cilantro whatever seasonings you enjoy Instant broth cans or cubes Pasta and other noodles Rice How to Read a Recipe It s true and is often said that all you need to know in order to cook is how to read a recipe But how do you read a recipe These tips will up your chances of culinary success 1 First things first read through the recipe in its entirety It s easy to look only at a recipe s ingredients before deciding to make something But when it comes time to prepare the dish you may find you don t have a tool or ingredient that may only be mentioned in the directions or that it s a lot more complicated than you thought and a little above your pay grade If the recipe includes terms you don t recognize look them up 2 Add up how much time it will take Be sure to check out the prep time slicing stirring can opening and cook time baking frying grilling Add them up to find the total time needed to complete the dish If it s your first time making a certain recipe it will definitely take you longer than the given time give yourself an ample cushion 3 Make sure you have all the ingredients If you think you might have something already but aren t sure check to see Also make sure it s still fresh Then write a list of all the ingredients you don t have on hand 4 Take note of what you need to do before the preparations begin Before you start slicing dicing and mixing you may need to do things like preheat the oven soften butter or defrost meat 5 Set out all of your ingredients and tools Line up everything you will need bowls pans and utensils are on the counter ingredients are measured and ready to go This will not only make things smoother as you go along saving you from dashing to and from the fridge and the cupboards but it s basically a chance to check off the recipe s ingredient and supply list one more time you don t want to get halfway through your preparations only to realize you re \\\\u00bc cup short of the required 1 cup of flour Measuring Ingredients Dry Measurements Versus Wet Measurements When a recipe calls for a \\\\u00bd cup of this and 2 cups of that the tool you reach for depends on whether the ingredient is dry or wet if it s pourable oil sauce milk it s wet There are two options wet measuring cups and dry measuring cups While they technically each hold the same volume there are reasons why you should choose one or the other for respective ingredients A liquid measuring cup has small measurement gradients printed up the side and the top fill line sits well below the spout so you don t spill any liquid when you pick up the cup When you fill a wet measuring cup don t hold it in your hand put it on a level surface and squat down to make sure the liquid is sitting right at the desired mark Dry measuring cups are meant to be filled up to the very top and then leveled off with a knife If you filled a dry measuring cup to the very brim with a liquid you d be bound to spill some And if you used a wet measuring cup for a dry ingredient you wouldn t be able to level it off Here s how you fill a dry measuring cup with a few common ingredients Flour lightly spoon into cup and level off with knife Don t tap the cup to settle or pack in with spoon or fingers White sugar scoop directly from bag container Level off with knife Brown sugar scoop and then press with back of a spoon until the sugar is level with the brim of the cup Peanut butter shortening pack with spatula spraying the cup with cooking spray before using PB will result in it sliding out easier Tablespoons Versus Teaspoons A common mistake beginner cooks make is to confuse the tablespoon with the teaspoon as they are often abbreviated in recipes in different ways and these abbreviations are very similar You may see any of the following Tablespoon T tb tbs tbsp tblsp tblspn May be capitalized or lower case Teaspoon t ts tsp tspn Almost always lower case A tablespoon is larger than a teaspoon In the US one tablespoon equals three teaspoons You can use tablespoons and teaspoons for both wet and dry ingredients A recipe may call for a level or rounded amount rounded roughly sits above the rim of the spoon level is done by scraping off the top with a knife Butter A stick of butter will have the measurements printed on the wrapper of each stick Just mark off what you need and cut through the butter wrapper and all Basic Cooking Skills Every Young Man Should Master There are tons of cooking techniques out there and down the road you may want to learn to make a souffl\\\\u00e9 or smoke some ribs But it really only takes a few basic how tos to keep yourself well fed and happy First we ll cover one of the most basic of the basics how to make pasta and then I invite you to click on the images below to learn more simple but handy skills How to Make Pasta Pasta is an especially good option for young men it s cheap versatile and relatively good for you depending on what you add to it It s also really simple to make At least it should be But I didn t realize I was making it wrong until after I got married Kate was aghast to see me put the pasta in right after filling up the pot with water instead of waiting for the water to boil A recipe for mushy pasta Here s how to do it right 1 Use about 5 quarts of water for a pound of pasta That sounds like a lot but a common mistake is to use too little water which leads to the pasta sticking and clumping together When planning your mealtime keep in mind that that much water takes a while to boil especially because you want to start with cold water as it absorbs the least amount of impurities from your pipes 2 Choose a pot that will leave you some room on top so the water doesn t boil over 5 quarts of water in an 8 quart pot works well If all you ve got is a 6 quart er just keep a close eye on it 3 Bring water to a rolling boil This means it s boiling across the whole surface of the water and you can t stop the boil by stirring it Putting a cover on the pot will help it reach this point faster 4 Once boiling add two tablespoons of salt The salt boosts the boiling temperature slightly and adds a little flavor to the pasta But fear not it only raises the pasta s sodium content a tiny bit 5 Add the pasta and stir it around immediately to keep it from sticking together as the strands release their starch as they hit the heat Stir the pot again every few minutes until pasta is done 6 Consult the pasta package for relatively accurate cooking time A minute before the minimum given cooking time on the package is up fish out a strand with tongs and bite into it The consistency you re looking for is al dente Italian for to the tooth tender but with a little bite Keep in mind that the pasta will continue to cook a bit even after you remove it from the heat 7 As soon as the pasta reaches desired doneness dump it into a colander Pick up the colander and give it a few shakes to get the water out But don t overstrain it a little wetness works well with sauce Don t rinse the pasta either unless you re making a cold pasta salad as it rinses away the starch that coats each strand and this starch will help the sauce stick to the pasta 8 Toss pasta with sauce immediately if you can If you can t toss the pasta with a little olive oil to keep the strands from sticking to each other Click the images below to read past AoM articles on basic cooking skills What Can I Make With Even if heading out on your own means setting up camp in a college dorm with a meal plan in hand that doesn t mean cooking can t have any place in your life for the next two semesters There will be times when you don t feel like making your way over to the cafeteria or food court and times when they won t be open leaving you to pillage the dorm vending machine And unless you have an unlimited meal plan making some meals for yourself can save you money Of course whether you re headed to a dorm room or perhaps a tiny studio apartment that only offers a kitchenette or you do have access to a kitchen but not the assortment of appliances and pots mentioned above you may feel like it isn t possible for you to make anything with such limited room and equipment But with a little creativity you can truly whip up some tasty stuff for yourself with only the most Spartan of supplies Below we offer a few suggestions for things you can make if you only have one or more of the following appliances What Can I Make with a Fridge and a Hot Pot This is the situation many college freshmen will find themselves in dorm rules often allow students two appliances in their rooms a small refrigerator and a hot pot an electric kettle that quickly boils water Obviously the number of things you can make with these appliances beyond ramen and mac n cheese of course is limited but there are still options Salad Get some salad makings raw veggies pre cooked chicken and dressing toss together Cold sandwiches You don t have to limit yourself to bologna and cheese either There are hundreds of really good sandwich combos out there Don t forget wrap sandwiches too get a Caesar salad kit mix add some precooked chicken mix and wrap Oatmeal Get the kind that s not quite old fashioned whole oats but are a step up from instant Add nuts and dried fruit Hard boiled eggs Portable and nutritious snack Canned soups Easy nutritious and can hit the spot on a winter s day What Can I Make with a Microwave Some dorms allow microwaves in students rooms or have a common microwave for all to use It is a surprisingly versatile tool good for more than heating up your Hungry Man dinners Scrambled eggs This was a staple of mine freshman year and not as bad as you might think Scramble the eggs in a bowl and nuke for 60 90 seconds stopping to stir once or twice Add salt pepper and ketchup to taste You can also poach and fry eggs this way But never cook them in their shell as they can explode and always prick the yolk if you leave it intact Bacon What are eggs without bacon Layer a plate with three paper towels place bacon strips on top and cover with another paper towel Cook at about one minute per slice Bean and cheese burrito Warm up some refried or black beans and layer in a tortilla with cheese guacamole salsa sour cream whatever your heart desires Rice Tasty Bite Soup You can make instant rice in the microwave or they even sell pre cooked rice in a package that only needs to be warmed up Add some beef stew or Tasty Bite Indian food on top of the rice The latter is a good option for vegetarians Pizza bagels Better in a toaster oven for sure but fine in a pinch Corn on the cob Yes you can actually make it in the microwave Steamer meals Primer Magazine did a great well primer on how to use microwave steam bags to cook up tasty and super nutritious meals You add meat veggies and sauce to the special bags and steam in the microwave Sample recipe Beef fajitas strips pineapple onion bell peppers red green yellow BBQ sauce Image from Primer Magazine What Can I Make with a George Foreman Grill Obviously George s Lean Mean Grilling Machine is adept at cooking things like burgers and chicken breasts but it handles meats like bacon and sausage patties well along with making good grilled cheese sandwiches paninis of any variety and tasty quesadillas too I wouldn t go out of my way to get one though it s one of those things that sounds handy but will end up gathering dust on a shelf At least it did for me What Can I Make with a Rice Cooker A rice cooker is basically a steamer and a hot plate and if you have a microwave and a hot plate or regular stovetop you don t need one unless you enjoy using it and have the space But you might live in a dorm that allows rice cookers but not hot plates and if that s the case take heart despite the name this appliance can cook a lot more than the white stuff eggs spaghetti chicken soup and even taco meat and spare ribs can be whipped up in one What Can I Make with a Crockpot The ladies have been all over crockpotting lately and it s perplexing more men don t adopt this cooking tool as it s one of the easiest least time intensive methods of cooking available One of my favorite crockpot meals is stupidly simple plop in a couple of chicken breasts pour some BBQ sauce over them and then let it cook on low for six hours or on high for four When it s done you shred the chicken and pile it on some Texas toast Delicious I also enjoy making easy beef stew throw in some stew meat cut up potatoes carrots and green beans and then some V8 juice and other spices to taste Press cook Go about your day Enjoy your stew hours later Hundreds of other tasty crockpot recipes are only a Google search away What Can I Make with a Hot Plate Stovetop and One Pot If you have a hot plate or stovetop but your cookware is limited do a search for one pot meals These are just what the name implies and they make clean up a snap Easy chili is one of my go tos brown hamburger meat at the bottom of the pan add a can of drained pinto beans diced tomatoes and a packet of chili seasoning Simmer for 10 15 minutes Done I like to ladle mine over some Fritos and top with cheese It s not going to win any prizes in a chili cooking competition but it s really satisfying on a cold winter s day Also check out Matt s post on one skillet meals that are proportioned for the bachelor the stir fry has become a staple around here But Brett I don t even have any of the things above Is there anything I can make for myself Maybe you re living in a dorm that s super strict about appliances in rooms Well there is one trick you can use get out your iron Yes the one you use to get the wrinkles out of your shirts Iron Made Grill Cheese First I ll show you how to make a classic comfort food staple the grilled cheese using an iron in your dorm room What you need an iron a towel aluminum foil butter two slices of bread and two slices of cheese Heat up the iron to its highest setting no steam as you get things together You ll want to iron on a towel or some other protective surface Butter the bread I might have gone a little too crazy with it on this slice Tear off a piece of foil that is big enough to wrap your sandwich Put down the first slice of bread butter side down on the foil Slap on two slices of cheese and then put down the second slice of bread butter side up on top Wrap up the sandwich in the foil You don t want your grill cheese getting on your iron Place your iron on top and let it sit there for 1 2 minutes Cook time will depend on how hot your iron gets so the first time you try this check on it 45 seconds in to see how it s fairing and to make sure it doesn t burn Once one side is done flip the foil packet over and repeat on the other side Boom Grilled cheese sandwich Adjust the toast level to your personal preference There you go the perfect accompaniment to your late night study sessions You can also add turkey or ham to make the sandwich heartier Iron Made Bacon Not only can you add turkey or ham to your grilled cheese you can also add some bacon Here s how What you need bacon foil towel and iron Tear a strip of bacon in half you can make more or less depending on the size width of your iron and place on foil Wrap in foil and crimp the sides you don t want any bacon grease to escape Set iron packet on a towel and place iron on top Let it sit there for about 5 minutes check to see how it is doing and then flip and repeat Again cook time will depend on the heat of your iron and desired doneness of the bacon Be careful when you open the foil it s hot And there you have it Freshly cooked bacon In your dorm room Made with an iron Okay cooking with an iron isn t too practical but it s really quite simple and fun Give it a try your lady friend or roommate will be delighted to know a real iron chef Yar yar yar Got any other basic

       "  u'{title:Political interests linked to brain structure study ,body:Wondering what politics has to do with brains Well an intriguing new research published online in Current Biology provides a scientific backing to why liberals and conservatives cannot stand each other in terms of political views According to the researchers from the University College of London differences in political orientation are a result of differences in brain structure While liberals tend to have larger anterior cingulate cortexes the part of brain involved in decision making during conflicting situations conservatives on the other hand have larger amygdalas part of grey matter involved in the processing and memory of emotional reactions Based on what is known about the functions of the two brain regions findings of the present study suggest that liberals have a greater ability to cope with conflicting situations and conservatives have heightened sensitivity to threats the Science Daily reports Lead researcher Dr Ryota Kanai from the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at theUniversity College London said in a press statement Previously some psychological traits were known to be predictive of an individual s political orientation Our study now links such personality traits with specific brain structure 90 adults studiedThe study analyzed brain structures of 90 healthy adults who reported their political views on a scale of one to five from very liberal to very conservative For this purpose Kanai and his colleague Professor Geraint Rees Senior Research Fellow at the Wellcome Trust scanned their brains using magnetic resonance imaging MRI Also the research team measured the amount of grey matter brain tissue consisting of nerve cell bodies rather than fibres present in different brain areas The study was originally commissioned by The King s Speech actor Colin Firth when he appeared on Radio 4 Today programme last December and led by Wellcome Trust UK s largest non governmental charitable organization FindingsPsychologists noted that conservatives have a greater ability of recognizing threats in the face of uncertainty due to smaller anterior cingulate region of brain linked with courage and looking at the brighter side of life Conversely liberals are better equipped to face uncertainty and conflicts and are more inclined to new experiences they said People with a large amygdala are more sensitive to disgust and tend to respond to threatening situations with more aggression than do liberals and are more sensitive to threatening facial expressions the study said Liberals are linked to larger anterior cingulate cortexes a region that monitor s uncertainty and conflicts it said Thus it is conceivable that individuals with a larger ACC have a higher capacity to tolerate uncertainty and conflicts allowing them to accept more liberal views Further political persuasions can fall into many more categories than just liberals or conservatives For example some people might not have any interest in politics and some who may agree to an all different opinion other than liberal or conservative In principle our research method can be applied to find brain structure differences in political dimensions other than the simplistic left versus right wingers Kanai said Altogether the study found that political persuasions are encoded in the structure of brain Interestingly the researchers also examined the brain make up of two MPs Conservative MP Alan Duncan and Labour MP Steve Pound The results tallied with the findings of their study Further research neededHowever researchers are unclear whether the structural differences in brain cause the difference of opinion or are the effect of them and cautioned against taking the findings too far It s possible that brain structure isn t set in early life but it might get shaped over the time with experiences and training It s very unlikely that actual political orientation is directly encoded in these brain regions he said More work is needed to determine how these brain structures mediate the formation of political attitude  healthcare, health news, healthcare news, medical updates, medical news, fitness news. herbal products, diet and weight loss, hospitals in india, health news india, brain, conservatism, current biology, decision making during conflicting situation, heightened senstivity to threats, liberalism, politics, research, university college of london,url:themedguru 20110410 newsfeature political interests linked brain structure study 86144325 html}',\n",

and blueberries There are 24 hours in a day which equals to 1 440 minutes wouldn t you think that you can find 5 minutes in a whole day that s merely 0 3 of the whole day to do something good and special for yourself Dissecting it that way is a no guilt way of looking at it isn t it and coming from a Catholic background that s no small joke For reference previous tiny journeys in my kitchen posts 1 a simple lunch 2 coffee for you 3 Mediterranean simplicity pasta al limone 5 minutes a dayEvery day for 5 minutesI will take the time tosit and meditatetake in the weatherlook at you in aweplay outsidewrite a few wordstake a photostore a memorymaybe even make cakedefinitively say thanksand just be me Even if it s just for 5 minutes Lately I have been in this mode of cooking less but more efficiently if you know what I mean Over the winter I made plenty of elaborate dishes that took a lot of time to prepare but now that spring is approaching I just want to spend less time in the kitchen yet still enjoy delicious meals Some nights especially in the middle of week we all feel like having a little sweet ending to our meals but who has time to bake a cake when there is homework to review dinner to be made laundry to be folded work to be finished and most importantly kids that want to play fort And who has the desire to turn on the oven and wait for an hour especially as the weather warms up If you have not heard of the success of the 5 minute microwave cake you have to try them out they have been a web sensation for quite a while now They are certainly not the French bakery s equivalent but they do satisfy that un demanding craving for something sweet on any given day Personally and I think you know that of me by now I am not a fan of processed foods so I don t really used cake boxes etc So when I saw this microwave recipe idea that uses just good old fashioned pantry ingredients I was so excited The kids helped me make a version of it then of course I had to adapt it to my likes Hence these two versions one is a chocolate cake with a few great optional flavorings I like real chocolate chunks and a hint of espresso powder and the other one is a lemon cake I like adding blueberries which burst open in the microwave The whole thing comes together in 5 minutes with a cooking time of less than 3 The texture is a bit spongy but if you serve it with ice cream or whipped cream that spongy ness will absorb all the juices and that s a great feature I think it is a great week night treat and you can jazz it up even for a casual dinner especially if you add ice cream or whipped cream and fruit on the side which make for a nice presentation Chocolate cake in a tea cupMakes 2 mini cakes4 tablespoons flour 3 4 Tbsp sugar I use brown or turbinado 2 Tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder Dutch is best 1 tsp baking powder pinch of salt 1 egg 3 Tbsp milk 3 Tbsp oil or you could substitute melted butter 1 4 tsp vanilla extract 2 Tbsp chocolate chips Optional

       "  u'{title:3 Things that Come in a Box that You Should always make from Scratch ,body:I think it s time for America to get back to their cooking roots and stop buying pre packaged and prepared foods which only require you to throw them in the Microwave for 3 minutes and their ready I understand that it s saves time and that it s easier but when you take the time to make it yourself it s often times healthier cheaper and tastier I m not even going to get into what companies do to their food to make it storable and grocery store friendly I am going to focus on three foods you should make from scratch because they are easy to make better than their store bought counterpart and cheaper I have been on this kick recently to rediscover foods by making them from scratch rather than buy them prepackaged I have been overwhelmed with how easy it can be and how much better it is than the store bough item 1 Popcorn Popcorn is one of my favorite snacks to make at home This one is a huge money saver if you eat a lot of popcorn because popping it yourself is a whole lot cheaper than buying the packages at the store I make my own kettle corn at home as well and it s easy to make and delicious Making popcorn is as simple as putting oil in a pot and adding popcorn until it pops Then just add butter and salt and whatever else you want on your popcorn and your done Kettle corn is also pretty simple Just add a 1 4c oil to the pan and let it get hot and then add 1 2c popcorn and 1 4c sugar Once the popping start put on the lid and start to shake the pot forward and back and left and right to prevent the sugar from burning Once the popcorn popping slows immediately transfer it into a bowl and let it cool After it s cools sprinkle on some salt and your ready to go It s that easy after a couple of tries you will get the hang of it and will be a pro in no time 2 PancakesMy friend Matt and I discovered the other day just how easy it was to make our own pancakes Ever gotten up one morning and really wanted pancake but discovered you were out of pancake mix Who needs pancake mix when you only need basic ingredients that your kitchen probably already has This is literally all you need to make pancakes Dry ingredients combine first 1 5 Cups Flour 3 tablespoons sugar1 75 teaspoons baking powder1 teaspoon salt Combine and add to dry once pan is hot1 5 cups milk3 tablespoons butter2 eggs 5 teaspoons Vanilla Extract VIA the Joy of CookingI mean come on if you don t have these things in your kitchen you must not cook at all and you probably haven t made it this far in this post anyway My friend and I made these with his freshly ground whole wheat flour and the pancakes were out of this world good 3 Southern Style Biscuits 2 cups flour 4 teaspoons baking powder 1 4 teaspoon baking soda 3 4 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons shortening 1 cup buttermilk chilledI love a good biscuit and they are also something that is surprisingly easy to make I mean come on just look at the ingredients The only problems might be the shortening which you can buy in bulk and keeps forever and the buttermilk which is good but can be substituted for regular milk if you want This is another thing you can just whip up without a lot of planning or know how For direction on how to make these see the recipe here Honorable Mention Cinnamon RollsI left out Cinnamon Rolls from my list because they take a lot more time to make than the store bought ones All the other foods on my list might take a little bit more time than their store bought counterparts but not by much These however have to rise for an 1hr 1 5hrs so just that wait makes them less convenient They are however 100X better than the store bought ones and should be on your list to make for sure I have two recipes for your consideration One from Paula Dean and the other from the Pioneer Woman Both of which sound good and follow the same procedure but the Pioneer Woman s recipe has a maple icing that sound ridiculously good and yes that is what the image above shows Paul Dean s recipe is a little bit more traditional but also sounds great apple, reviews, technology, imac, mac, computers, software, blogiversity.org: authentic, unique and off the beaten path. news, forums, cartoons & comment from blogiversity.org; politics, finance, music, editorials, how to, tech reviews, economics, photos, video, privacy, science & entertainment. ,url:blogiversity org blogs willburns1 archive 2011 02 01 3 things that come in a box that you should always make from scratch aspx}',\n",

comments If you are a steak lover I hope that the title of this post luscious photo is enticing enough for you to read though the entire article Because I promise you that it s worth it Even if you don t eat steak this is a must read as you can impress the hell outta your carnivorean friends and sometimes when you re a vegetarian in a herd of carnivores it would just be nice to have that extra dude you didn t know that about steak in your pocket My entire family including the 2 yr old kid just adores any type of steak recipe you could probably classify us as professional steak eaters In fact it is my husband s life long quest to hone his grilling technique so that our steaks at home turn out charred crusty on the outside and perfectly medium rare on the inside With grill marks for show of course Seriously we are too cheap to eat out and would rather cook a nice steak recipe at home For the past 4 months we have been experimenting with how to get full juicy beefy flavor of a ribeye with butter knife tenderness of a filet mignon without feel like getting ripped off buying Prime cuts And after 4 months of eating steak 2x a week I think we ve figured it out So my friends I am offering you a very juicy secret one that will turn an ordinary Choice cut of steak into a gucci Prime cut And yes I know what Choice and Prime means it s the marbling The salting doesn t affect fat content I m using those terms as a figure of speech and something people can relate to Do you know the joy of buying Choice and eating Prime It s like buying a Hyundai and getting a free mail in rebate for a BMW upgrade The Steak Secret massively salt your steaks 1 hour before cooking for every inch of thickness Notice that I didn t say sprinkle liberally or even season generously I m talking about literally coating your meat It should resemble a salt lick Here s two nice pieces of regular ol supermarket steak They re about 1 25 inches thick so I ll let them salt for about 1 25 hours Season liberally with kosher salt on both sides And then just let it sit on your counter After 15 minutes it will look like this you can see how the meat s water is starting to come up to the surface and that some of the salt is still on the surface of the steak After 30 minutes you ll see more water After almost an hour And now 1 25 hours see all that water You can also see that there s still salt on the surface of the steak The next step is to discard the water rinse the steak really well to rid of all the salt Pat very dry Very very dry with clean paper towels so that absolutely no moisture is left on the steak Then it s time to cook Before y all throw a hissy fit just hear me out I first learned of this technique from Judy Rodgers The Zuni Cafe Cookbook A Compendium of Recipes and Cooking Lessons from San Francisco s Beloved Restaurant Judy massively salts her chicken before roasting and I ve adapted the practice to steaks Thanks to a couple of other books McGee s On Food and Cooking and Alton Brown s I m Just Here For the Food and a few fellow bloggers I have an explanation of how it works Oh and if the drawings look like a 3rd grader did it too bad YOU try drawing with a laptop touch pad and a glass of bourbon on the rocks All of you who season JUST before grilling this is what you are really doing to the meat Did you know that All the water comes to the surface and if you don t pat super dry you re basically STEAMING the meat Plus your salt just sits on the surface of the steak leaving the interior tasteless Now note that only a little of the salt gets to go back into the meat Don t worry you aren t going to be eating all that salt Bourbon does that to me too I can hear it now BUT What of all the water that stayed on the surface of the meat Aren t you drawing all the moisture out of the meat Will it taste like a salt lick I DON T UNDERSTAND THIS STEAK RECIPE Pull your pants back on and keep reading Cook s Illustrated January 08 issue and you can also find it on their paid portion of their website Just search for Improving Cheap Roast Beef They salt a 4lb roast beef big fat thick meat and they are using 4 tsp kosher salt therefore their steak recipe recommends salting for 18 24 hrs It s all related thickness of meat amount of salt time Use kosher or sea salt not table salt that is important It will not work well with tiny tiny grains of table salt Plus table salt tastes like shit Use steaks 1 or thicker Follow my timetable below If you are Harold McGee a member of Alton Brown s research team or Mr Burke my high school chem teacher and think I m full of B S please let me know But guys none of this was in your books I had to formulate extrapolate hypotholate and guesstulate based on your stuff Highly mental activity I know this sounds awfully like salt curing which dries out meat like beef jerky But with salt curing you use A LOT more salt and leave it salting for A LOOOOOONG time We re talking about a little tiny nap here not weeks just enough to break down the proteins and flavor the steak throughout Again don t worry about all that salt Just enough of it gets absorbed into the meat Most of it gets washed down the drain when you rinse off Really I know you re going to ask so I ll answer it for you Why not brine You could if you really want water logged diluted tasting crappy steak I understand that this method will cause chaos confusion and controversy in your household But I encourage you to experiment try adding spices crushed garlic and rosemary sprigs to the salt which will then act like Christina Aguilera dragging its entourage of flavors with it into the meat If confusion in the household becomes unbearable just whack em with the hunk of salted steak Revised 9 13 10 to make salt ratio and timing easier to remember1 Buy a good sized Choice steak I like mine 1 25 to 1 5 inches thick Any cut of steak Filet Sirloin Rib Eye Porterhouse T Bone and NY Strip they all work Though please remember to get steak that you d normally buy to grill Don t go buying some weird cut like the cow armpit and expect it to taste just like a NY Strip You can do this with steaks less than 1 just really watch your timing If your steak is already superbly marbled cut back on your timing and your salt The fattier more marbled the meat is the faster the salt works its way through the meat 2 Sprinkle 1 2 to 1 teaspoon of kosher sea salt PER SIDE Use the photos at beginning of the post as guide on how much salt For every inch thickness of steak let sit at room temperature for 1 hour Less than 1 inch steak 30 45 minutes1 inch thick steak 1 hour1 25 inch steak 1 hour and 15 minutesIf you don t have that much time well then add more salt cut back the time it sits It s all related Thickness of meat Amount of Salt TimeAnd vice versa if you need to stretch your time use less salt Example the above steaks that are 1 25 thick I should salt for 1 hour 25 minutes But if my timing works out that I m not grilling for 2 hours then I ll cut back on the salt and let it sit for 2 hours If you want to salt for more than 2 hours or overnight sprinkle the steak with 1 2 the amount of salt that I ve instructed look at photos for reference cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 3 Rinse all salt off on both sides pat very dry with paper towels on both sides that part is important Season with fresh ground pepper no more salt is needed Grill to your liking Top with Garlic Herb Butter immediately to let it oooooze and aaaahhze all over the steak Garlic Herb Butter Recipe1 stick of unsalted butter softened not melted just softened handful of fresh herbs any combination is fine My fav is basil and parsley 1 3 cloves of garlic smushed in garlic pressTo make the Garlic Herb Butter combine all ingredients Lay out a sheet of plastic wrap Spoon butter mixture on wrap Roll and shape butter into a log Refrigerate to firm up for 30 minutes Slice into 1 4 disks to top the grilled steaks You can make butter up to 3 days in advance Make sure you use unsalted butter the steak is seasoned perfectly already Another use for herb butter Notice the consistency in ingredients first photo and the one below perfect steak always go so well with homemade shoestring fries or homemade potato chips The green stuff is just to give color to the plate Unless it has garlic herb butter slathered all over it too How to dry age steaks at home with Drybag method Watch me talk about Kobe Beef Burgers on CBS Artisan Steak Tasting taste test of 6 steaks from small artisan

       "  u\"{title:From Last Night s Dinner To Today s Lunch Add Taste Save Cash MintLife Blog ,body:photo Jeffrey Beall With Labor Day around the corner getting back in the habit of packing a tasty and healthy lunch is a good back to school resolution for you and your kids Obviously eating out instead of bringing a lunch can be a serious drain on your budget When Frugal Foodie met Mr Foodie back in the day he was putting aside 80 per week for lunches out Now he s a frugal convert we both put together lunches that are a version of the previous night s meal The key phrase a version of BYO lunch is a little easier to stomach when it s not simply a repeat of the night before It can also be a lot cheaper than buying ingredients for something entirely new So this week we asked chefs and home cooks to submit their favorite dinner to lunch reinventions Post yours in the comments Here s what they came up with Dinner Spaghetti and meatballs Break up the ground beef with a little sauce and spread atop a pita or English muffin with some cheese for a personal pizza says Amy Trapp of St Louis My family can then have a say in the type of pizza they eat and I do not have to watch unused spaghetti sauce become a lab experiment in my fridge or forget about it in the freezer she says Stuff meatballs and sauce in a roll or pita for an impromptu sub Dinner Roast Chicken or Turkey Make a zesty chicken salad Michelle Ann Anderson the author of The Rotisserie Chicken Cookbook mixes together two cups shredded chicken a quarter cup each of grated red onion Italian salad dressing and minced cilantro half a seeded diced jalapeno the juice and zest of one lime and two tablespoons orange juice in a small bowl Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or up to overnight then serve solo or on rolls with lettuce Stephanie Petersen of Chef Tess Bakeresse came up with a turkey salad version that incorporates pesto and apples Serve on a croissant Wrap up in pot stickers Anderson suggests Place a half cup each of chicken and baby spinach a half teaspoon curry paste a quarter cup shredded carrot one chopped green onion and a half cup coconut milk into bowl of food processor Pulse until mixture is coarsely chopped and well blended Place a bit less than one tablespoon filling in center of won ton wrapper you ll need about 32 Moisten edges with fingertip dipped in water and fold in half pressing to seal edges Cook in batches for two to three minutes without turning in three tablespoons of either peanut or vegetable oil Then pour a third of a cup water into skillet cover and simmer on low heat for another three to four minutes Serve sprinkled with one chopped green onion and Thai sweet chili sauce for dipping Try an adult version of popular kids food Hot Pockets Petersen s recipe takes some work but the combo of chicken feta and banana peppers wrapped in pesto molasses bread is pretty tempting Dinner Pork or ham Thread leftover chunks onto skewers interspersing with fresh uncooked veggies such as tomatoes and mushrooms It s a unique way to use leftovers and make lunch fun for the kids says Danielle Omar a registered dietician known as the Food Confidence Expert http www foodconfidence com This method also works for chicken salmon shrimp and tofu Layer into a grilled cheese sandwich Indianapolis resident Evan Strange suggests using leftover BBQ or pulled pork in less conventional ways as a topper for pizza or a filling for tamales Dinner Steak Health coach Robin Fischman makes cold steak tacos by pairing steak slices with avocado tomato and corn scraped off the cob Roll in a soft tortilla or add to hard taco shells The folks at Laura s Lean Beef suggest turning grilled steak fajitas into fried rice by sauteeing the leftover steak and veggies with scrambled eggs rice and soy sauce Dinner Meatloaf Eula Young of New York makes turkey loaf the same as meatloaf with ground turkey The next day she uses the leftovers as a Sloppy Joe Just chop up the turkey loaf and put it in a pan with Sloppy Joe sauce chopped onions and green peppers to taste and let it cook down Use it on whole wheat rolls or with cooked noodles or rice Frugal Foodie cubes her meatloaf and sautes it in a little olive oil to give each piece a crispier crust and then uses the pieces to top a salad of mixed greens tomatoes and Dijon mustard vinaigrette Dinner Grilled vegetables Chop and saute with some rice an egg and soy sauce for fried rice Fischman says With a little time odds and ends can become a tasty fermented treat a la sauerkraut Leftover grilled vegetables with some pesto on really great toasted whole grain bread makes a great vegetable sandwich Fischman says Frugal Foodie is a journalist based in New York City who spends her days writing about personal finance and obsessing about what she ll have for dinner Chat with her on Twitter through MintFoodie eating out instead of bringing a lunch can be a serious drain on your budget. but eating yesterday's dinner for lunch can quickly get boring. the solution: create a fresh, tastier version with these recipes. food,frugality,url:mint blog saving lunch ideas 09012010}\",\n",

the checkout line Now you can easily slash your bill with some clever shopping moves and DIY recipes Manufacturers would like to make you think you re getting a good deal in exchange for convenience but it s really just eating away at your food budget Don t be fooled any longer Cross these items off your list for good iStockphoto Thinkstock 1 Bottled water Bottled water is a bad investment for so many reasons It s expensive compared to what s coming out of the tap its cost to the environment is high it takes a lot of fossil fuel to produce and ship all those bottles and it s not even better for your health than the stuff running down your drain Even taking into account the cost of filters water from home is still much cheaper than bottled water which can run up to 1 to 3 a pop If you have well water and it really does not taste good even with help from a filter or if you have a baby at home who is bottle fed and needs to drink safe water buy jugs of distilled or nursery water at big discount stores They usually cost between 79 cents and 99 cents for 1 gallon as opposed to 1 50 for 8 ounces of designer water And you can reuse the jugs to store homemade iced tea flavored waters or when their tops are cut off all sorts of household odds and ends PLUS 19 Weight Loss Secrets From Around the World2 Gourmet frozen vegetables Sure you can buy an 8 ounce packet of peas in an herbed butter sauce but why do so when you can make your own Just cook the peas add a pat of butter and sprinkle on some herbs that you already have on hand The same thing goes for carrots with dill sauce and other gourmet veggies 3 Premium frozen fruit bars At nearly 2 per bar frozen all fruit or fruit and juice bars may not be rich in calories but they are certainly rich in price Make your own at home and get the flavors you want The only equipment you need is a blender a plastic reusable ice pop mold on sale at discount stores for about 99 cents each or small paper cups and pop sticks or wooden skewers PLUS 10 Tips for Proper Portion ControlTo make four pops just throw 2 cups cut up fruit 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 teaspoon lemon or lime juice into a blender Cover and blend until smooth You might wish to add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water so the final mix is a thick slush Pour into 4 ounce pop molds or paper cups insert sticks and freeze until solid 4 Boxed rice entree or side dish mixes These consist basically of rice salt and spices yet they re priced way beyond the ingredients sold individually Yes there are a few flavorings included but they re probably ones you have in your pantry already Buy a bag of rice measure out what you need add your own herbs and other seasonings and cook the rice according to package directions Enhance your IQ with our new Word Power game 5 Energy or protein bars These calorie laden bars are usually stacked at the checkout counter because they depend on impulse buyers who grab them thinking they are more wholesome than a candy bar Unfortunately they can have very high fat and sugar contents and are often as caloric as a regular candy bar They re also two to three times more expensive than a candy bar at 2 to 3 a bar If you need a boost a vitamin rich piece of fruit a yogurt or a small handful of nuts is more satiating and less expensive Download the Life IQ trivia game for your iPhone6 Spice mixes Spice mixes like grill seasoning and rib rubs might seem like a good buy because they contain a lot of spices that you would have to buy individually Well check the label we predict the first ingredient you will see on the package is salt followed by the vague herbs and spices Look in your own pantry and you ll probably be surprised to discover just how many herbs you already have on hand Many cookbooks today include spice mix recipes particularly grilling cookbooks But the great thing about spice mixes is that you can improvise as much as you want Make your own custom combos and save a fortune PLUS 6 Condiments You Can Make From Scratch7 Powdered iced tea mixes or prepared flavored iced tea Powdered and gourmet iced teas are really a rip off It s much cheaper to make your own iced tea from actual inexpensive tea bags and keep a jug in the fridge Plus many mixes and preparations are loaded with high fructose corn syrup and other sugars along with artificial flavors So make your own and get creative To make 32 ounces of iced tea it usually takes 8 bags of black tea or 10 bags of herbal green or white tea Most tea bag boxes have recipes so just follow along If you like your tea sweet but want to keep calories down skip the sugar and add fruit juice instead 8 Microwave sandwiches When you buy a pre made sandwich you re really just paying for its elaborate packaging plus a whole lot of salt fat and unnecessary additives For the average cost of one of these babies 2 50 to 3 00 per sandwich you could make a bigger better and more nutritious version yourself See 7 more foods you should never buy

Capacity 37 493 night 37 065 day Opened 1912Teams Boston Red SoxSure it s the oldest MLB stadium currently in use but what makes Fenway Park unique is its angular dimensions and unorthodox left field

       "  u'{title:Barbecue Pork Ribs Baby Back or Spare Recipe File ,body:writing down my recipe for barbecue pork ribs for a couple years now I kept avoiding it to prevent runaway discussions on whether or not this is the best way or the correct way to barbecue ribs I finally decided to just sit down and write it This is how I do my ribs barbecue style They come out delicious tender and juicy and full of smoky flavor The texture of the ribs after cooking is not falling apart The meat doesn t fall off the bone when you prod it with a fork For that you ll want to take a look at Recipe File Oven Baked Spare Ribs which will produce meat and cartilage that is just completely falling apart However the ribs will be tender enough that it ll come off the bone easily when you re eating it and the texture will provide just enough chew to be satisfying I think that s the best texture for ribs even though sometimes I do like the completely falling apart texture as well that s why I have more than one recipe for making ribs This recipe is more of a method than a firm step by step because there s a lot of flexibility when it comes to barbecuing ribs I usually smoke at least two racks of ribs a rack is one side of the hog one continuous cut of meat that includes 8 to 15 ribs depending on your butcher and the style of cut at a time but cooking one rack is pretty much the same exact recipe cooking times don t change only the amount of spice rub you use up Before we start you ll need pork ribs Baby back ribs come from the loin of the hog and the bones are generally smaller and the flesh is leaner and meatier than spare ribs which come from the side and belly Because of the leanness of baby back ribs the cooking time is less about 1 1 2 hour compared to 2 1 2 hour than that of spare ribs In the photographs for this recipe I prepared baby back ribs but I ll mention the differences between preparation for baby back and spare ribs in the text You ll also need a dry rub I like using the rub from my Grilled Pork Chops recipe In fact I usually prepare a large quantity of the rub and put them into jars so I can use them whenever I need it Alternatively you can use a store bought spice rub like those found at Rod s Rub For glazing a barbecue sauce is needed My Slow Simmered Spicy Barbecue Sauce is a crowd pleaser but I like trying out other people s sauces and playing with a variety of store bought sauces as well Wood chips hickory or mesquite both work really well are also needed Part of what makes barbecue ribs authentic is the taste of smoke permeating the meat Since the ribs cook in just a couple hours the smokiness will be fairly mild Let s begin The night before you plan on barbecuing prepare your pork ribs Working with one rack at a time lay the rack on a large cutting board You ll want to trim off any excess meat because they won t cook at the same rate as the rib meat Usually baby back ribs don t come with any extra flaps of meat but spare ribs St Louis style and country style ribs often do Cut them off and save them for a stir fry or other pork dish Flip the rack over so the meaty side is face down There is a thin membrane on this side that goes over all the bones Removing this membrane is optional but generally a good idea It can become a very tough sheet that tastes and feels like you re chewing on plastic if you cook it with the ribs To remove it just thrust a blunt object like the blunt tip of a thermometer in between the membrane and the bones as shown in the photo Wiggling your tool around a little should give you enough room to get a finger beneath the membrane Once you ve got a grip on the membrane pull it away from the back of the ribs You ll need to use some force but if you re smooth about it the membrane should come away as one piece Using a paper towel can help you grip the membrane better if your fingers keep slipping Cover both sides of the rack with a generous portion of spice rub I generally use about 1 2 cup of rub per rack of ribs Make sure you use your hands to rub the mixture into the ribs The moisture from the pork should be enough to make the rub stick and coat easily After both sides have been rubbed with the spice rub place the rack onto a large sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil The foil should be large enough to wrap the entire rack in it just image you re going to gift wrap the ribs Fold the foil over the ribs and fold the aluminum foil onto itself to seal just like you would if you were preparing to freeze it For photographs explaining the folding and crimping technique please refer to Kitchen Notes Freezing Meats Do the same steps removing excess meat removing the membrane spice rub and wrapping in foil for each of the other racks of ribs that you might be preparing Put them onto a sheet pan and slip it into the refrigerator so the rub can do its thing We ll want to leave the ribs in the fridge for at least 10 12 hours The salt and sugar in the rub should draw out some moisture from the ribs which serves two purposes First it firms up the flesh a little bit and second helps provide moisture to the rub which turns it into a paste and then a liquid The liquidly rub penetrates into the meat during the next several hours so it s important to wait before cooking the ribs About an hour before you plan on cooking soak 2 cups of wood chips in water for that hour Prepare a grill for indirect heat For a charcoal grill start a fire and move the coals to one side leaving the other side without coals For a gas grill turn on the burners only on one side If your grill doesn t have burners on just one side then I suggest you rig up something so your ribs will be much higher up and away from the flames than they normally would be You ll also need a rib rack a metal device that looks like a desk top filing rack not to be confused with a rack of ribs which is the cut of meat that a rib rack is designed to help you cook If you don t have a rib rack or don t want to buy one then just use a V rack for roasting chickens and turkeys Flip it over so the point of the V is facing up and stick it on the grill That s how I do it Place the rack on the side of the grill without direct heat Remove the wood chips from the water If you ve got a charcoal fire going put the wood chips directly onto the coals where they should begin to smolder If you re using a gas grill place the wood chips into a smoker box or an aluminum foil sheet shaped into a box with holes punched in the top like the one in the picture and put it on the side where the flames are on Turn the fire up until the chips begin to smoke and then turn the heat down to low Remove the ribs from the refrigerator and unwrap them If the racks are too long to fit on the rib rack on your grill then you might have to cut them in half Insert the racks or half racks into the rib rack so they are standing up Position them so they are as far away from the heat source as possible Close the lid Every twenty minutes open the lid and rotate the ribs Move each rack closer to the heat source then move the rack closest to the heat source to the position farthest from the heat After about 1 1 2 hours for baby back ribs or 2 1 2 hours for spare ribs the meat should have shrunk away from the bone substantially The temperature of the rib meat should be over 180 F which means much of the collagen in the meat has probably converted to juicy and unctuous gelatin the reason we love ribs At this point pull the racks off the grill and clear off the smoker box and rib rack Redistribute the heat so it is even throughout the grill for gas grills use medium heat Place the racks of ribs back onto the grill and brush on your favorite barbecue sauce Every three minutes flip the racks and brush more sauce on Repeat until you re tired have run out of sauce or can t wait any longer Cut the ribs apart to serve That s it Follow these steps correctly and you should have some great barbecue ribs step

movements - cnn.com,body:Police attempt to disperse a crowd at Occupy Portland on Sunday STORY HIGHLIGHTS Author Protests are modeling themselves after networked personal technology These movements have lots of leaders instead of one or two Micah Sifry says New leadership mode is a strength and not a weakness author argues Editor s note Micah Sifry is co founder of the Personal Democracy Forum a website that examines how technology is changing politics and the author of WikiLeaks and the Age of Transparency This commentary is part of a series of Campaign Tech articles that will run through 2012 and explore technology s role in the presidential election CNN A column by New York Times Public Editor Arthur Brisbane on Sunday raised a plaintive question Who is Occupy Wall Street In the piece he searches desperately for the leaders behind what is today s hottest political phenomenon In the course of an admirably open exploration of how the Times should report on the Occupy movement going forward he along with a group of his journalistic peers whom he consulted for advice revealed a telling assumption about how political movements must work Though he quotes a commenter on his blog who told him that the movement s lack of traditional leaders is part of its message he can t let go of the idea that it must have leaders An investigation into its origins would lead to the identities of early leaders at least and the search for the broader leadership of the movement should continue from there he writes A sampling of leading journalism educators that Brisbane polled many of them former top newspaper editors agreed Most said it was important to understand who the leaders were and what demographics they represented Brisbane reports Leadership tells you a lot about a movement Jerry Ceppos the former executive editor of the San Jose Mercury News told Brisbane But I can t I can t cite the name of a single Occupy Wall Street leader I know some members say the groups are leaderless But I have trouble believing that this is an entirely organic movement that grew without a leader I d push hard to see if there are leaders and to profile them Why this insistence on finding the supposed leaders of Occupy Wall Street The reason goes beyond a desire to understand the movement s goals I think into something more existential that is rooted in a fundamental misunderstanding of how networking technology is changing politics For many traditional political observers such as Brisbane and his colleagues the notion that a political movement might arise without charismatic leaders is inconceivable Every previous movement after all has had its figureheads Think of Gandhi MLK Mandela Or at the less exalted level of recent times think of Ralph Nader Al Sharpton or Michael Moore on the progressive left or Sarah Palin Mark Meckler and Jenny Beth Martin on the Tea Party right The same question was raised if you recall around the Arab Spring uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt which were often described as leaderless A movement can t be leaderless right Who would we feature on the front page Who would we put on the Sunday talk shows Who would we negotiate with Or if you re feeling some distress about politics in America today who might lead us to cure all that plagues us from economic doldrums to climate change to failures of leadership in so many other institutions from corporate boardrooms to the church to college football programs Is there a savior rising from these streets No political movements can t be leaderless The Occupy Wall Street movement is in fact leader full But it s a vastly different kind of leadership that is emerging It s one that like the networked technology that supports it rejects all forms of top down hierarchy and values peer to peer network weaving instead Ilyse Hogue a progressive activist who was on the staff of MoveOn for many years recently put it this way in one of the first uses of the term leader full that I have seen We should all strive not for leaderless movements but for leaderFULL movements The former trends towards autocratic loudest voices dominating In their best manifestation the latter creates equitable space to raise up all voices create mechanisms for group decision making and accountability and to catalyze self responsibility and empowerment Most of us come from a world and a generation that only knows one kind of leadership the one whose organizational structure looks like a confusing government flowchart Everything about our industrial age institutions from schools and churches to corporations and government trains us to think of leadership as top down command and control Give the right answer get into the right school get a good job work your way up the chain of command win the good life But today more and more of us live in a sea of lateral social connections enabled by personal technology that is allowing everyone to connect and share in real time what matters most to them And at a moment when so many traditional political institutions appear bankrupt incapable of reforming themselves and paralyzed in the face of huge challenges the result is an explosion of outsider movements for social change whose structure looks more the masses of people that gathered in Egypt s Tahrir Square the pro union demonstrators in Wisconsin or the Occupy Wall Street protests around the country Indeed I think there s a reason we keep seeing this recurring image of a filled circle rather than a hierarchy in today s protest movements All the points on a circle are equidistant from the center Spots in the middle are hubs but no one hub dominates Resilience is built through the multitude of lateral connections between all the points in the network so if any hub fails others can pick up the slack And thus today s networked movements are not only highly participatory with many leaders instead of just one they are also much stronger than movements of the past that could be stopped or stalled by the discrediting arrest or killing of their singular spokesmen Going from a world of top down leaders who use hierarchy secrecy and spin to conduct their business to a leader full world filled with self starting network weavers who are transparent and accountable about their actions will take some getting used to But the Occupy Wall Street movement like the Tea Party before it was captured and turned into a marketing vehicle for the Republican right represents the flowering of something very deep about our networked age It is personal democracy in action where everyone plays a role in shaping the decisions that affect our lives We may face huge challenges but while some of our material resources are in scarce supply we have an abundance of leaders coming The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sifry micah sifry says a different kind of leadership, which is fueled by new peer-to-peer technology, is emerging in the occupy movement. micah sifry says a different kind of leadership, which is fueled by new peer-to-peer technology, is emerging in the occupy movement. ,url:edition cnn 2011 11 14 tech web occupy wall street

be a Serious Health Risk for Everyone By Adetutu Ijose ndash Author ndash Lessons I Learned the Hard Way People who work with computers generally are aware of the discomfort that comes with the glare but do not associate it with any serious health issues moreover the need to meet deadlines overshadows any such thoughts if discomfort does occur Computers are here to stay and can never be safe as claimed The computer use environment makes us look directly at a source of light which is contrary to our natural way of never looking directly at the sun our natural source of light Most people do not even realize that computer use by its nature generates chemical and electrical imbalances and other stresses every time one uses the computer They also are unaware of the fact that disorders develop over time and can be easily misdiagnosed because they present themselves in forms that resemble other ailments Health complaints to many doctors however do not necessarily lead to a computer related connection Some doctors usually look for other reasons to explain the ailment because it is not a well known area in the medical field People with these complaints however do not respond fully to the treatments given for the ailments they resemble Consequently people go from one ailment to the other because the root cause has not been addressed The medical profession cannot be totally blame as there are no books or papers that bring all the various disorders together as one comprehensive diagnosis of computer related injury or disorder What is available are books and research on individual areas of concern such as carpel tunnel computer vision syndrome this area is not even know by people outside the ophthalmological or optometric field neurotransmitters etc These books and papers take each area but there is nothing that links all of them In for example the issue of neurotransmitter nothing links them specifically to computer use only to general stress amongst several other deficiency symptoms There is therefore a need for everyone to know what dangers they are increasingly exposing themselves to and how to manage their exposure to avoid negative health consequences some of which may be irreversible and possibly fatal in some cases As a result there is no information out there to warn of the inherent health dangers involved in computer use G Jeffrey MacDonald of the Christian Science Monitor wrote in 2004 an article in the USATODAY titled Too much computer exposure may hinder learning In it he mentioned a mammoth new study by researchers at the University of Munich involving 175 000 15 year old students in 31 countries that brought some sobering news Too much exposure to computers might spell trouble for the developing mind They observed that performance in math and reading had suffered significantly among students who have more than one computer at home It was also observed that stated that while students seemed to benefit from limited use of computers at school those who used them several times per week at school saw their academic performance decline significantly as well G Jeffrey MacDonald also stated in his article that the lead researcher Ludger Woessmann said that It seems if you overuse computers and trade them for other types of teaching it actually harms the student At least we should be cautious in stating that increasing access to computers in the home and school will improve students math and reading performance In December 2006 I had what can be referred to as computer burnout This gave rise to a host of very serious complications Neither the doctors seen nor I for about 8 months knew what was going on or how to deal with it What was not realized was that this was something that had gradually developed over more than 2 decades of computer use and not simply the stress from excessive workload during the months of October to December while trying to meet a client s deadline Since this computer burnout in December 2006 I have carried out a lot of research in a bid to understand what I was experiencing in order to get back my normal self I was surprised to discover that there were several things that could have been done to avert a full computer burnout In addition I also discovered things that could assist in achieving a speedy recovery Who knew that working on the computer could result in exposure to lead or development of acute iron deficiency Who thinks about chemical and electrical imbalances while working with the computer An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure when it comes to avoiding the unnecessary pain many people suffer today as a result of computer burnout I share my experiences and years of health research in an easy to follow handbook which identifies common symptoms of computer related injuries To get a copy go to http www strategicbookpublishing com LessonsILearnedtheHardWay html This book will help you not only prevent injuries but

       "  u'{title:Sugar Is a Poison Says UCSF Obesity Expert ,body:By Jeffrey Norris on June 25 2009 The rise of obesity is usually blamed on too much eating and not enough exercising but Robert Lustig MD a UCSF pediatric neuroendocrinologist asks us to look beyond the obvious Yes more Americans are overweight today than 30 years ago Kids are still getting heavier compared with prior generations of kids That leads some UCSF researchers to warn that heart disease and other health problems will grow in future decades But behaviors that some might refer to as gluttony and sloth are merely consequences of the true cause of the epidemic Lustig says Food was just as abundant before obesity s ascendance The problem is the increase in sugar consumption Sugar both drives fat storage and makes the brain think it is hungry setting up a vicious cycle according to Lustig Robert Lustig MD More specifically it is fructose that is harmful according to Lustig Fructose is a component of the two most popular sugars One is table sugar sucrose The other is high fructose corn syrup High fructose corn syrup has become ubiquitous in soft drinks and many other processed foods Lustig presented his case against fructose in a recent UCSF Mini Medical School course on diet and nutrition part of a series sponsored by the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute Audience members may have been surprised to hear such unequivocally strong statements from a researcher Lustig framed the obesity epidemic as a societal issue that pits the food selling agenda of federal agencies and profit seeking behavior of major corporations against public health needs Lustig quit working in the lab a decade ago Now he spends more time with pediatric patients He is on the front lines of the world s weight woes treating kids who already are obese a condition that sets the stage for health problems that begin long before these children become adults Lustig still conducts clinical research He evaluates dietary lifestyle as well as pharmacologic interventions that might hold the pounds at bay He tracks down associations between diet lifestyle and health outcomes in an effort to identify biological mechanisms that will explain them Insulin and Leptin Lustig s own groundbreaking studies more than a decade ago stimulated the development of his controversial ideas about metabolism and biological feedback in weight control One not yet popular idea is that calorie for calorie sugar causes more insulin resistance in the liver than other edibles The pancreas then has to release more insulin to satisfy the liver s needs High insulin levels in turn interfere with the brain s receipt of signals from a hormone called leptin secreted by fat cells Lustig believes In the 1990s Lustig worked with children diagnosed with hypothalamic obesity a disorder that can occur after brain tumor surgery The children were making more insulin than was necessary for normal energy storage in fat cells Lustig thought the kids were not receiving signals from leptin which helps send a message that the appetite has been sated Lustig concluded that the children s brains were fooled into thinking that they were starving Lustig administered a drug called octreotide known to block insulin release Insulin levels fell the children ate less lost weight spontaneously became more active and improved their quality of life Lustig tried the same treatment with obese adults and found that a subset responded in the same way as the children with hypothalamic obesity Eating stimulates secretion of insulin and leptin The conventional view holds that insulin like leptin feeds back in the brain to limit food intake Lustig explains But Lustig does not think that chronically elevated insulin levels feed back negatively to curb eating Instead chronically elevated insulin blocks leptin s negative feedback signal Lustig believes Most people think insulin does the same thing as leptin he says I think it does just the opposite Lustig believes that fructose generates greater insulin resistance than other foodstuffs and that fructose calories therefore fail to blunt appetite in the same way as other foods A Calorie Is Not Just a Calorie Lustig also is at odds with mainstream scientific viewpoints when it comes to explaining how fructose is shunted through biochemical pathways and converted into fat and other molecules Unlike conventional calorie counters Lustig does not believe all food calories have the same impact on fat storage and energy expenditure regardless of whether they come from fat protein or carbohydrate Fructose a type of carbohydrate is not metabolized like other foodstuffs and not even like glucose the other major carbohydrate Lustig says In addition Lustig claims that fructose is just as bad as alcohol in causing fat storage in the liver and in causing fatty liver disease Lustig advances these controversial ideas primarily by citing already published studies most of them by other researchers But he also tries to enlist bench scientists in research collaborations in the hopes that additional studies will prove to others that these ideas are correct Sugar No Better Than Fat Each sucrose molecule consists of one molecule of fructose joined to one molecule of glucose In the gut these two components are quickly split apart High fructose corn syrup is a less expensive mixture of glucose and fructose There is no point in belaboring the difference Lustig says High fructose corn syrup and sucrose are exactly the same Lustig says They re equally bad They re both poison in high doses Over the past century Americans have increased their fructose consumption from 15 grams per day to 75 grams per day or more Lustig explains The trend accelerated beginning about three decades ago when cheap easy to transport high fructose corn syrup became widely available Much of processed food labeled reduced fat instead has sugar added to make it more palatable Lustig says But when it comes to harmful health effects sugar is worse than fat he claims Consumption of either results in elevated levels of artery clogging fats being made by the liver and deposited in the bloodstream But fructose causes even further damage to the liver and to structural proteins of the body while fomenting excessive caloric consumption Lustig says Four Simple Guidelines Lustig prescribes four simple guidelines for parents coping with kids who are too heavy Get rid of every sugared liquid in the house Kids should drink only water and milk Provide carbohydrates associated with fiber Wait 20 minutes before serving second portions Have kids buy their screen time minute for minute with physical activity Fructose is abundant in fruit Fruit is fine Lustig says but we should think twice before drinking juice or feeding it to our kids The fiber in whole fruit contributes to a sense of fullness Lustig says it is rare to see a child eat more than one orange but it is common for kids to consume much more sugar and calories as orange juice Eating fiber also results in less carbohydrate being absorbed in the gut Lustig notes In addition he says fiber consumption allows the brain to receive a satiety signal sooner than it would otherwise so we stop eating sooner Exercise burns only a modest amount of calories Lustig notes But it does have other benefits Exercise improves insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle lowering insulin levels in the bloodstream Exercise reduces stress and therefore reduces stress induced eating according to Lustig Lastly exercise increases metabolic rate The directive to balance active play with computer video and TV time is the most difficult one to comply with Lustig says But failure to limit sugar intake appears to be the most predictive of poor weight control in children he adds You are not what you eat you are what you do with what you eat Lustig concludes And what you do with fructose is particularly dangerous Related

exposure,body:NaturalNews Ask somebody about sunscreen and you re likely to receive an earful of disinformation from a person who has been repeatedly misinformed by health authorities and the mainstream media Almost nothing you hear about sunscreen from traditional media channels is accurate So here s a quick guide to the 7 most important things you need to know about sunscreen sunlight and vitamin D It s true If you create a truly natural sunscreen product using exotic botanicals with powerful sunscreen properties you will never be able to market it as a sunscreen product That s because the FDA decides what can be used as sunscreen and what can t regardless of what really works in the real world And there are really only two natural ingredients the FDA has allowed to be sold as sunscreen Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide Any other non chemical sunscreen ingredients if sold as sunscreen would be considered mislabeled by the FDA and result in your products being confiscated even if they offer fantastic sunscreen protection Not surprisingly this whole monopoly over sunscreen chemicals is designed to protect the profits of the chemical companies while marginalizing the natural product companies which could easily formulate far better solutions I have personally spoken to the founders of several health product companies who have figured out amazing sunscreen formulations using nothing but natural botanicals but the FDA won t let them market their products as sunscreen products It s just another example of the FDA standing in the way of health innovation Read the ingredients list of any sunscreen product sold at Wal Mart or Walgreens or any other mainstream store I dare ya You will not be able to pronounce most of the chemicals found in the ingredients list That s because most sunscreen products are formulated with cancer causing fragrance chemicals parabens harsh alcohols toxic chemical solvents and petroleum oils A typical sunscreen product is actually a chemical assault on your body That s why research shows that using sunscreen actually causes more cancer than it prevents http www naturalnews com 023317 skin chemicals products html Vitamin D deficiency is perhaps the most widespread vitamin deficiency in North America According to the research 70 percent of whites are deficient in vitamin D and up to 97 percent of blacks are deficient http www naturalnews com 030598 vitamin D Institute of Medicine htm Chronic vitamin D deficiency promotes cancer http www naturalnews com 031560 vitamin D cancer html winter flu and infections depression osteoporosis and hormonal imbalances Depending on whom you believe vitamin D alone can prevent anywhere from 50 to nearly 80 of all cancers http www naturalnews com 021892 html By blocking vitamin D production in the skin sunscreen products actually contribute to cancer promoting nutritional deficiencies This doesn t mean you should never wear a sunscreen product of course If your skin is really pale and you re planning a day on the beach in Hawaii you will obviously benefit from some level of sun protection using a truly natural sunscreen product But an informed health conscious person would try to allow their skin to achieve a natural healthy tan yes a tan truly is healthy if it s combined with good nutrition see below through sensible exposure levels that activate vitamin D production in the skin Here s the real secret about sun exposure that no one in conventional medicine is talking about because as usual they are woefully ignorant about nutrition You can boost your internal sunscreen by eating antioxidant rich foods and superfoods The supplement astaxanthin for example is very well known for boosting your skin s natural resistance to sunburn Its fat soluble carotenoids are actually transported to skin cells where they protect those cells from UV exposure The more natural antioxidants you have in your diet the more sunlight your skin will be able to handle without burning Nearly everyone mistakenly believes that a person s sunlight burn response is purely a genetic factor They re wrong You can radically improve your resistance to UV exposure through radical dietary changes I m a great example of this actually as I used to burn in just 20 30 minutes of sunlight when I was on a junk food diet years ago But now as someone who eats superfoods and high end nutritional supplements every day I can spend hours in the sun and will only turn slightly red which fades a few hours later and does not result in a burn or skin peeling Except for one time on an all day visit to a water park I have not worn sunscreen in over 8 years I spend a large amount of time in the sun and I have absolutely no concerns whatsoever about skin cancer My skin most people tell me looks significantly younger than my biological age That s not from sunscreen it s from nutrition Sun exposure does not make your skin age if you follow a high nutritional density diet It is a complete medical myth that UV exposure causes skin cancer This false idea is a total fabrication by the ignorant medical community dermatologists and the profit driven sunscreen companies The truth is actually more complicated Skin cancer can only be caused when UV exposure is combined with chronic nutritional deficiencies that create skin vulnerabilities To create skin cancer in other words you have to eat a junk food diet avoid protective antioxidants and then also experience excessive UV exposure All three of those elements are required Conventional medicine completely ignores the dietary influences and focuses entirely on just one factor Sunscreen vs no sunscreen This is a one dimensional approach to the issue that s grossly oversimplified to the point of being misleading The medical industry it seems does not want people to figure out they can literally eat their way to healthier skin It s amazing actually Your skin is made entirely out of the food you eat so how could your diet not affect your skin health Yet no one in conventional medicine not the dermatologists not the doctors and not the health regulators has the intellectual honesty to admit that what you eat largely determines how your skin reacts to UV exposure Be careful when shopping for so called natural sunscreen products While there are some good ones out there many are just examples of greenwashing where they use terms like natural or organic but still contain loads of synthetic chemicals anyway A good guide for checking on sunscreen products is the Environmental Working Group guide EWG at http www ewg org skindeep Some of the products that are truly natural include Loving Naturals sunscreen and Badger All Natural Sunscreen Read the ingredients labels to see for yourself Don t use any sunscreen product containing ingredients that sound like chemicals Methyl Propyl Butyl Ethyl Trieth Dieth etc Always buy unscented sunscreen unless for some reason you just enjoy coating your skin with artificial perfume chemicals A typical sunscreen product is made with over a dozen cancer causing fragrance chemicals and they re absorbed right through your skin Most sunscreens when applied as directed are really just toxic chemical baths that heavily burden your liver and can give you cancer Search Amazon com for chemical free natural sunscreen and you ll see a listing for Jason Natural Cosmetics Earth s Best Sun Block Chemical Free 4 oz creamClick on the product and you ll find a listing of its ingredients which includes C12 15 Alkyl Benzoate Caprylic Capric Triglyceride Sorbitan Isostearate Sorbitan Sesquioleate Ethylhexyl Palmitate Ethyl Macadamiate Calcium Starch Octenylsuccinate Stearalkonium HectoriteSo how are those not chemicals Ethylhexyl Palmitate is NOT a chemical Who are these people kidding The Amazon com description title of this product is false and misleading In all fairness however this product title looks like it was added into the Amazon com system by the vendor and not the Jason company itself But it s an example of how the information you see from online vendors can often be misleading Always read the ingredients of any sunscreen product before using it Don t poison yourself with sunscreen Perhaps more with sunscreen than any other personal care product the official information distributed through the mainstream media is hopelessly misleading if not downright false Remarkably no one in the media or the government is even willing to admit that fragrance chemicals are bad for your health Similarly no one is willing to admit that the chemicals you put on your skin get ABSORBED by your skin Without those two truths being acknowledged right up front the rest of whatever they say about sunscreen is worthless babble Any honest talk about sunscreen must acknowledge the simple truth that the chemicals you put on your skin get absorbed into your skin and that most sunscreen products are made out of a chemical cocktail of cancer causing substances This is the truth about sunscreen that both the sunscreen industry and the cancer industry doesn t want you to hear It s the dirty little secret of sunscreen The more you use the more you CAUSE cancer in your body And the more money the cancer centers make treating your cancer with yet more deadly chemicals known as chemotherapy So buyer beware Sunscreen products are a minefield of lies fraud and disinformation designed to keep you ignorant of the importance of sun exposure as well as the health risks associated with using cancer causing chemicals on your skin Stick with truly natural sunscreen products when needed and try to build up a healthy tan while consuming large quantities of superfoods and antioxidants in your diet Consider taking astaxanthin or other fat soluble nutrients on a regular basis Engage in daily juicing of fresh fruits and vegetables which are loaded with living nutrients Time your sun exposure to build up a healthy tan so that you don t need sunscreen at all Contrary to all the misinformation we ve all been fed a healthy tan is actually a good sign that you re achieving adequate vitamin D synthesis in your own skin Learn more about

       "  u\"{title:In the path of the storm Daredevil photographer risks his life to take stunning pictures of lightning strikes in the path of the storm: daredevil photographer risks his life to take stunning pictures of lightning strikes ,body:By Nadia GilaniLast updated at 3 35 PM on 13th October 2011 Fearlessly placing himself directly in the path of deadly lightning strikes a photographer captures images that highlight the terrific violence of nature Obsessed since childhood with the massive thunderstorms of South Africa s high veld plains Mitchell Krog 39 has been taking pictures of lightning for 16 years Giving his photographs dramatic names such as Fire and Ice and Killer Storm Mr Krog who lives in the Magaliesburg region of South Africa has captured some of the most impressive lightning strikes committed to camera Holding his image of three simultaneous strikes just outside Pretoria called Monumental Chaos as his photographic masterpiece he has a devil may care attitude towards his dangerous photography Monumental Chaos The moment when three massive lightning strikes hit the earth within 15 seconds at Voortrekker Monument just outside Pretoria Mitchell Krog says it is his masterpiece He said I don t fear lightning so whenever possible I will happily place myself directly in the path of an approaching storm and I ve dodged some close strikes Since I was a young child I have had a fascination with electrical thunderstorms I grew up on the high veld of South Africa where our summers are filled with thunderstorms I m a bit of a daydreamer and easily mesmerised so I would often spend hours watching storms brew and would only run inside once the lightning or rain let me With each storm I photographed I felt myself wanting more and I kept finding new ways of pushing the envelope and improving on what I had done before It was in early days of the Southern Hemisphere summer that he snapped his stunning work Monumental Chaos I was on my way home from Pretoria when I saw a massive storm front brewing to the east he says I quickly made my way to the Voortrekker Monument just outside Pretoria as I just had a feeling I would have a chance of being directly in the storm s path Often the problem with lightning photography is that it starts raining before the storm is close enough to capture and before I knew it the rain started pelting down so much so that the monument completely disappeared from view and this forced me to quickly seek shelter in my vehicle The rain started slowing down after a few minutes and I knew I had to dash back out of the vehicle as I knew it was by no means over Then came the first of some big very and very close lightning strikes and in between wiping my lens I was constantly adjusting settings to cater for what may or may not come next A gigantic storm cell sends out streams of lightening into the air north of Johannesburg in this image titled Killer Storm Johannesburg city is engulfed in lightning strikes in Johannesburg Electrified While I do own a lightning trigger I seldom use it as I prefer full manual control over my exposures using only a cable release and this day was no different Then came the moment of what I termed Monumental Chaos when three massive lightning strikes came tumbling down to earth within 15 seconds I initially thought the closest strike was just too close and that it would have blown my exposure but when I brought it up on the LCD screen I must have been grinning from ear to ear In nearly six years of storm photography this single image portrays more than any other image I ve taken the sheer chaos and power of a lightning storm Going professional two years ago Mr Krog has captured the effects lightning has on the surrounding environment on the dry plains of South Africa He added With my image Fire and Ice I was inside cooking dinner for my wife when I heard what I thought was thunder I turned the heat down on the stove and rushed outside to see if it was true or if I was merely imagining things What I saw took my breath away and I dashed inside to grab my camera Some lightning strikes had started a grass fire which was causing the whole sky to glow a beautiful red orange colour and in amongst this all lightning strikes were dropping from the sky creating the most incredible contrasting colours This remains to be one of my most memorable images Lightning strikes drop from the sky left in Fire and Ice while a grass fire caused by a previous strike lights the sky a beautiful red orange colour right in Magaliesburg South Africa High point Working during a storm at sunset is what inspires Mr Krog most as in this photograph Stormy Sunset where a lightning bolt strikes during a storm at sunset in Magaliesburg South Africa Observing storms from start to finish Mitchell is all too aware of the power of storms I spent about an hour photographing one storm but eventually only ever settled on this one image to publish he said The next day I read on various news web sites how some violent storms had hit some parts of Johannesburg even causing a few deaths The headlines were Killer Storm and I went with that as the title of the image However for Mitchell the high point of his photography is working during a storm at sunset My ultimate when it comes to storm photography is capturing a storm at sunset This requires being in the right place at the right time a little co operation from the elements and a certain amount of luck I ve captured a number of storms at sunset but they don t always work out the way I wanted them to but occasionally the pieces all fall into place as it does with Stormy Sunset This image also titled Stormy Sunset captures a lightening bolt as it strikes during a storm at sunset in Magaliesburg South Africa fearlessly placing himself in the path of deadly lightning strikes, mitchell krog, who lives in magaliesburg, south africa captures images like 'monumental chaos' (pictured) that

       "  u'{title:Sleep Apnea Studio Dentaire ,body:Obstructive sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder that can be life threatening Apnea comes from the Greek word apnea which means want to breathe This disease refers to episodes in which a person stops breathing for 10 seconds or more when asleep People with apnea may stop breathing dozens or hundreds of times every night During each episode of cessation of breathing the brain of the sleeping person wakes up momentarily in order to resume breathing These awakening if frequent might lead to fragmented sleep of very poor quality even if the person is unaware of it If you think you suffer from sleep apnea your dentist can work together with your physician to confirm the diagnosis and choose the right treatment Types of sleep apnea There are basically two types of sleep apnea both of which can seriously disrupt the sleep cycle Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when throat muscles relax to a point where the airway collapses This prevents air from entering through the nose and mouth but the breathing effort continues This is the most common type of apnea Central sleep apnea occurs when the breathing interruptions while sleeping are triggered by problems with the brain mechanisms that control breathing Symptoms of sleep apnea People who suffer from sleep apnea usually do not remember waking up during the night But there are several clues that may help suspect the problem Insomnia Choking with awakening during sleep Waking up with dry mouth or sore throat Frequent bathroom visits at night Morning headaches Excessive daytime sleepiness Concentration difficulty Memory loss Irritability Depression Excess weight Wide neck men over 17 inches women over 16 inches Loss of sex drive Gastroesophageal reflux Apnea versus snoring Snoring is often associated with sleep apnea since a person suffering from apnea tends to snore But snoring alone is simply the noise made by a person when asleep Therefore snoring does not compromise health However individuals with sleep apnea stop breathing completely for at least 10 seconds and this occurs dozens or hundreds of times per night The spouse could hear loud snoring punctuated by silences and then a choking sound before resuming breathing This sequence could signal sleep apnea Consequences of sleep apnea Sleep apnea has serious health consequences that could be life threatening If apnea is left untreated it can lead to impaired daily functioning with high blood pressure or even cardiac arrest or stroke Studies have shown that people who suffer from sleep apnea are very tired during the day If these people were driving a car or a truck their performance would be similar to a drunk driver What the dentist can do If your dentist suspects that you have sleep apnea he or she can refer you to a physician or to a sleep specialist The diagnosis will be based on medical history physical examination and the polysomnography test results The polysomnography exam takes place during one night of sleep and measures the heartbeat and the number of times breathing is interrupted while you sleep If the diagnosis is confirmed your dentist can work with your doctor or sleep specialist to treat your condition Treatment options If you suffer from mild obstructive apnea initial treatment may simply be a change of habits These changes include weight loss to stop smoking reducing alcohol consumption and avoid sleeping on your back There are also dental appliances that reposition the lower jaw and tongue in order to help you breathe better while you sleep But if you have severe apnea the therapy of choice is CPAP Continuous Positive Airway Pressure This machine carries air through a mask covering your nose and the constant pressure keeps the airway open This prevents snoring and also episodes of apnea The CPAP is however very noisy and is not always tolerated by patients and their spouses There are other treatments including surgery to reduce or eliminate sleep apnea Dental and Oral Problems Abscess Broken Fillings Bruxism Cavity Denture Irritation Dry Socket Fluorosis Gingivitis Gum Disease Halitosis Jaw Problems Malocclusion Oral Cancers Plaque Sleep Apnea Tartar Tooth Discolouration Tooth Sensitivity Ulcer Xerostomia References obstructive sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder that can be life-threatening.  apnea, sleep apnea, sleep, snore, snoring, breathe, breathing, causes, consequences, treatments, cpap, dental appliances,url:studiodentaire en conditions sleep_apnea php}',\n",

       "  u'{title:Cheese Making Illustrated ,body:THE NIGHT BEFORE YOU MAKE CHEESE 1 a Sterilize the pot The evening before you plan to make cheese place a small amount of water in your cheese pot cover and heat to boiling for 10 minutes to sterilize the pot and lid 1 b Warm 5 gallons of milk to 20 C 68 F in a sterilized pot skim the cream off of five gallons of the freshest milk save for ice cream Warm the milk to 20 C 68 F slowly so as to not scorch the bottom 2 Add starter Blend 1 cup yogurt with 2 cups warmed milk until smooth stir into the five gallons of warmed milk to thoroughly mix Alternatively you can use 3 tablespoonfuls of active buttermilk as starter Because the bacteria in buttermilk grow much faster at room temperature than those in yogurt do not incubate longer than 8 hours or warmer than 70 F or the milk may over adicify and begin to clabber Partially clabbered milk will not yield a clean break The function of this inoculation with bacterial starter is to lower the pH so that the rennet will be able to act on the milk protein casein 3 Cover with the sterilized lid Let the inoculated milk sit at room temperature overnight 68 72 F 20 22 C No external heat THE MORNING YOU WILL MAKE CHEESE 4 The next morning OPTIONAL skim off additional cream if you like it makes delicious pancakes Slowly warm milk up to 30 C 86 F Take care not to scorch it on the bottom 5 Dissolve the rennet Meanwhile dissolve 1 tablet of Rennet in 1 2 cup cold water Alternatively if you have liquid rennet you add 1 teaspoon per five gallons of inoculated milk 4 drops gallon I have only used tablet rennet but am assured that liquid rennet works just as well if fresh 6 Add dissolved rennet to warmed milk with stirringto mix Cover let sit undisturbed for 1 to 3 hours 7 TEST FOR A CLEAN BREAK THIS IS NOT A CLEAN BREAK To test for clean break completed action of rennet probe a clean finger into hopefully gelled milk and lift If the gelled milk is not firm enough to split cleanly as you lift let milk sit until clean break is obtained Do not stir This may take as long as 3 hours Be patient do NOT disturb the milk Keep warm Here is a page to help you diagnose the problem of inability to get a clean break 8 THIS IS A CLEAN BREAK When the gel is firm enough to break cleanly as the finger is lifted go to next step Here is a very large version of the clean break 9 Once a clean break is achieved cut the curd with a long blade Begin the cuts at one edge of pot cut straight down the side to bottom Cut repeatedly parallel to first cut but increasing the angle of the knife until you reach the other side of pot 10 Rotate the pot 90 degrees repeat series of cuts as before Rotate and cut a total of three more times four in all yielding \\\\u00bd inch cubes of curd Cover and allow the curds to settle for about 15 minutes Pour off the whey above the curds saving for ricotta if you like 11 Cook the curds After sitting for 15 minutes and pouring off excess whey place pot over a low fire stir curd with thoroughly cleansed bare hand by reaching down to bottom gentlylifting with an open hand to stir Cut larger curds as they appear Do notmash or squeeze If you want to set aside some for a type of cottage cheese remove a portion of the curds at this steps and refrigerate before you raise the temperature Stircontinuously as you heating curds will clump together otherwise until themilk is 34 C 95 F for soft curd cheese or as high as 39 C 102 F for very firm cheese Note you need a quality thermometer for this cooking step a small change in temperature makes a great deal of differencein the consistency of the curd cheese 12 Stir and maintain desired temperature until curd has contracted to consistency of firm scrambled eggs Remove from stove 13 Separate the curds from the whey Let the cooked curds sit for a few minutes The curds should sink in whey If the curds float you have a gas producing contaminant in your starter It does not necessarily ruin the cheese indeed you might WANT bubbles in your finished cheese Butfloating curds are more difficult to separate from the whey than sinking curds Decant off whey through a strainer you may line the strainer with clean cloth if the curd is very fine grained 14 Decant pour off as much of the whey as you can Drain well Save the whey for ricotta if you like 15 Place curds in a large bowl 16 Salt the curds Sprinkle 1 4 cup salt over curds working with hands to mix Pour off accumulated whey The salt is necessary so that the cheese will not spoil as it cures I have tried making cheese without salt and it rotted However unsalted uncuredcheese may be frozen until use 17 Load the press with the salted curds Place the still warm salted curds into a cheese press See separate page for assembly of cheese press It is necessary for the curds to be warm inorder for them to knit together to form a solid cheese during pressing 18 Press the curds Let sit in the press for 12 hours or so 19 Remove the cheese wrap in sterile bandage The next AM remove from press remove cloth rub outside of cheese with salt and wrap with fresh sterile handkerchief bandage 20 Age to develop a rind Place the bandaged wrapped cheese on a non corrosive rack plastic or stainless steel in the refrigerator Replace bandage daily as long as it continues to become wet Turn the cheese so that it dries evenly 21 Wax the cheeseWhen the cheese has formed a dry yellowish rind two or three weeks dip in melted wax store in refrigerator for at least a month if you can wait that long Let age longer for sharper cheese ,url:biology clc uc

Kitchen Featured We returned from Orlando around noon Sunday and after a quick stop at the grocery store and the long desolate drive down our long desolate gravel road I headed straight for my kitchen I d been gone for exactly two weeks As God is my witness I m never leaving my house again Until next week We ate in restaurants obviously the entire time we were in Florida and at Hard Rock Cafe twice I ordered things suggested to me by the waitresses both times I was there It s a hobby I have Just bring me something yummy I say Weird but wound up regretting not ever ordering a quesadilla they had on the menu one containing grilled chicken cheese and are you ready grilled pineapple I love grilled pineapple But it had never occurred to me to stick some inside a quesadilla Sometimes it takes me awhile So within an hour of returning home Sunday I d whipped one up I had to get it out of my mind and move on with my life Here s what you need Flour Tortillas Monterey Jack Cheese Pineapple Cilantro Chicken Breasts and Barbecue Sauce and whatever spices you d like to use to spice up the chicken Hack off the top of the pineapple And hack off the bottom Then you hack it down the middle Hack hack hack Then cut them into four wedges Then cut the four wedges to make eight wedges Then cut the hard triangular core off of each wedge They re kinda tough and useless Next cut off the hard prickly skin Stick a skewer through the pineapple lengthwise Set the skewers on a grill pan over medium to medium high heat Move the pineapple around as it grills Remove them from the cutting board and cut into thin slices Eat a few slices Faint from bliss Grilled pineapple is AWESOME You can just dice it up at this point and turn it into a salsa if you d like Yum Stick the chicken breast in a large plastic bag and pound it flat with a mallet or a large heavy can My mallet is in the bottom of our pond Thank you for understanding Place the chicken on a plate and sprinkle with salt and pepper Next sprinkle on whatever spices you like cumin cayenne taco seasoning anything I used this stuff It s spicy baby Next throw the chicken onto the grill pan or grill if you re into that sort of thing and grill it up Pour on a little barbecue sauce if you re into that sort of thing Remove the chicken from the grill pan Slice the chicken breast into thin slices and set aside Next pre grill the tortillas on a skillet I just swirl some butter or margarine around for awhile throw on the tortilla and cook both sides for a minute or two Do this until all eight tortillas are browned and set them aside in a pile Next grate up some Monterey Jack cheese You can use the pre grated stuff but it s coated in corn starch and will ruin your life But go ahead and use it It ll be fine Finally slice a jalapeno if you can HANDLE the spice I was feeling brave To assemble Start with a layer of grated cheese then arrange strips of chicken all over the top Next add slices of pineapple and sliced jalapeno Yum Finally drizzle on a little more barbecue sauce This is hot barbecue sauce by the way You don t have to add the barbecue sauce at the end Here s one without the sauce When they re all assembled throw them on a griddle Top each half with another tortilla and grill until golden and the cheese is melted Cut the quesadillas into six wedges And serve with sour cream pico de gallo and lots of cilantro Scrumptious Here s the handy dandy printable Note if you missed the Le Creuset wieners here s the post Prep Time 15 Minutes Cook Time 25 Minutes Difficulty Easy Servings 6 Ingredients

       "  u'{url:thekitchn thekitchn restaurant reproductions restaurant reproduction bestever veggie burgers from northstar cafe 096967,title:Recipe Best Ever Veggie Burgers from Northstar Cafe Restaurant Reproduction ,body:Even before we d been to the Northstar Cafe in Columbus Ohio we d heard about their veggie burgers They are unlike any other veggie burger you ve ever had we were promised by both vegetarians and non vegetarians We ll give you one guess what we ordered when we finally made it to the restaurant ourselves This burger definitely lived up to expectations It had a deep savory umami flavor that contrasted nicely with a slice of provolone we think cheese bitter greens and the buttery toasted bun We could see bits of beet black bean and brown rice in the mix but no single ingredient overpowered the other They also somehow captured that unique hamburger texture which is greatly lacking in so very many mushy veggie burgers The exterior was well seared to give the burger a beautiful crunchy crust and an extra boost of smoky flavor Then interior of the patty was soft and tender but with enough texture that we actually felt like we were biting into something The overall effect was quite simply a burger Because our addiction was edging toward the unhealthy we created this recipe in the spirit of the Northstar veggie burger The key is to dice the beets very small and then cook all the ingredients until they re very tender and soft Don t be tempted to use a food processor that would give you the mushy texture we re trying to avoid The other key is to sear the burgers very well in a hot cast iron skillet to get that flavorful crust You could also use a well oiled stainless steel skillet but a non stick skillet probably won t get the same kind of crust If you want to throw them on a grill cook them in a veggie basket or other grill top device so the patties don t break and fall through the grates One last note we think the original Northstar burger has about double the amount of brown rice as beets or beans that is to say a large proportion of rice as compared to everything else But in our testing we ultimately decided that we liked the meatier texture we got when those three ingredients were in more equal proportion We ve written the recipe as such but if you prefer the crunchier texture of the Northstar burger just double the amount of rice Best Ever Beet and Bean BurgersInspired by the veggie burgers at Northstar Cafe in Columbus Ohiomakes about 6 burgers 1 2 cup brown rice doubled if you like more rice 1 onion diced small3 large red beets about 1 pound diced small3 4 cloves garlic minced2 Tablespoons cider vinegar1 can black beans drained and rinsedjuice from 1 2 lemon1 Tablespoon extra virgin olive oil2 Tablespoons parsley minced1 teaspoon coriander1 2 teaspoon thyme2 Tablespoons all purpose floursalt and pepperthin slices of provolone or monterey jack cheese optional Bring a large amount of water to a boil Add a handful of salt and the rice and reduce the heat to a simmer Cook the rice until it s a little beyond al dente You want it a little over cooked but still firm This should take about 35 40 minutes Drain the rice and set it aside Heat a teaspoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium high heat Add the onion reduce the heat to medium and cook until the onions are translucent and softened Stir in the beets Cover the pot and cook until the beets are completely tender stirring occasionally Add the garlic and cook until it is fragrant about 30 seconds Deglaze the pan using the cider vinegar Empty the black beans into a large bowl and use a fork to mash them up a bit Add the cooked rice the beet and onion mixture the lemon juice the olive oil and all the spices Stir to combine and then taste for seasonings Add salt and pepper to taste Once it tastes the way you like it add the flour and stir until you see no more dry flour Heat a cast iron skillet over the highest heat Add a few tablespoons of olive oil the oil should completely coat the bottom of the pan When you see the oil shimmer and it flows easily the pan is ready Using your hands scoop up about a cup of the burger mixture and shape it into a patty between your palms Set it in the pan where it should begin to sizzle immediately If it doesn t sizzle wait a minute or two before cooking the rest of the burgers Shape and add as many more patties as will fit in your pan Once all the patties are in the pan reduce the heat to medium high Cook the patties for 2 minutes then flip them to the other side You should see a nice crust on the cooked side If they break apart a little when you flipped them just reshape them with the spatula they ll hold together once the second side is cooked If you re adding cheese lay a slice over the burgers now Cook the second side for another 2 minutes Serve the veggie burgers on soft burger buns or lightly toasted sandwich bread along with some fresh greens Cooked burgers should be eaten that same day You can also save leftover mix in the fridge for up to a week and cook just one or two burgers as you want them Related Meat Substitutes Love Em or Hate Em Image Emma

       "  u'{title:22 World s Most Spectacular Pedestrian Bridges TechFlesh ,body:This latest generation of newly constructed or retrofitted pedestrian bridges where cars are strictly off limits takes a number of forms Some exist primarily to thrill tourists Pedestrian bridges are going to cool new heights turning the need to get from here to there into an adventure Capilano Suspension Bridge Vancouver British Columbia Come face to face with wildlife in Vancouver s lush treetop ecosystem while strolling this skinny 450 foot long canopy bridge that floats 230 feet above the Capilano River Just 10 miles from downtown the bridge dates back to 1889 when a Scottish civil engineer strung a hemp rope and cedar plank to his isolated cabin Langkawi Sky Bridge Malaysia More like an observation deck this bridge to nowhere dangles spectacularly about 2 300 feet above sea level in Langkawi an archipelago on Malaysia s west coast It s reached by a harrowing cable car ride up Mount Mat Cincang and the bridge s gently curving promenade provides tourists with dazzling views of the Andaman Sea far below Every posted description of the bridge includes the not entirely reassuring phrase Langkawi sky bridge is safe The view is impressive and so is the engineering the bridge is suspended from a single mast that sticks up from the mountain below like a construction crane BP Bridge Millennium Park Chicago US Get an overview of Chicago s most impressive architecture not to mention Lake Michigan when you set out from the brushed steel Jay Pritzker Pavilion and amble along Frank Gehry s 925 foot long bridge above Columbus Drive Clad in shiny lizard skin patterned steel and paid for by its oil company namesake the overpass s only shortcoming is that it doesn t make it all the way to the water s edge you re left to fend for yourself on traffic filled Lakeshore Drive Puente de la Mujer Buenos Aires Argentina Architect Santiago Calatrava s Woman s Bridge on the Rio de la Plata is female by association the surrounding streets are named for noteworthy women such as human rights activist Alicia Moreau de Justo The bridge faces a new crop of trendy hotels restaurants and condos in Puerto Madero and can take some credit for inspiring the neighborhood s redevelopment Walkway over the Hudson Poughkeepsie NY USA It feels like you re walking in the sky This former railroad bridge is suspended 220 feet above a wide unusually straight stretch of the Hudson those Dutch seafarers once called Lange Rack or Long Reach That means you can see up and down the river for miles without any overhead structure to obscure the view The official website states that at 6 767 feet long it s the world s longest pedestrian bridge One not so small problem the Anping Bridge in Fujian China a stone pedestrian bridge dating from the 12th century is 526 feet longer Henderson Waves Bridge Singapore You can see why Singapore is nicknamed the Garden City Crossing from one hilltop park to another 118 feet above busy Henderson Road its highest pedestrian bridge overlooks treetops flowering bushes the harbor and the skyline Cooler still is this bridge s resemblance to a Slinky toy A sculptural wave of steel ribs follows the walkway periodically curling up and over the edge to create little coves of sheltered seating Singapore s Southern Ridges area is also home to the Canopy Bridge where you ll find wild orchids pitcher plants and tons of birds Kurilpa Bridge Brisbane Australia Masts attached to cables jut out from this bridge in all directions as if trying to distract your attention from the impressive cluster of skyscrapers lining the Brisbane River Powered by 84 solar panels Kurilpa looks its finest when the LED lighting system puts on dazzling shows It may appear to be a crazy jumble but the positions and the strength of the mast connections are the product of sophisticated calculation this is the first major bridge built according to the principles of tensegrity Rolling Bridge London England The payoff for pedestrians is usually the view from on high but here the bridge itself is the sight to see Each Friday at noon genius architect Thomas Heather wick s Rolling Bridge allows a single boat to pass in or out of its moorage You ll be transfixed as the bridge powered by hydraulic rams levitates upward as a unit and then curls backward allowing its eight triangular hinged sections to roll into a wheel The Rolling Bridge is one small element in a major redevelopment of the area around Paddington Station Other novel canal crossings include the Helix Bridge which screws and unscrew to allow boats to pass Infinity Bridge Stockton on Tees England Opened in 2009 this long bowstring bridge is named for the infinity symbol formed by its dramatic double curve and reflection in the River Tees The main arch is almost 400 feet tall and the span is nearly 900 feet creating a flamboyant wave Special nighttime lighting enhances the infinity effect and LEDs built into the handrails and footpath is programmed to change color as pedestrians and bicyclists pass by Another landmark Tees crossing the Middlesbrough Transporter Bridge completed in 1911 carries cars and pedestrians across the river in a suspended gondola 90 seconds each way Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge Omaha US The first pedestrian bridge to link two states extends for 3 000 feet over the bucolic Missouri and traces a gentle S curve around its two supporting towers a plaque marks the spot where you can have one foot in Nebraska and the other in Iowa Opened in 2008 and illuminated at night the bridge has become a teen hangout and has energized the waterfronts of two cities that haven t always been so hospitable to pedestrians On the Omaha side the bridge syncs up with a riverfront trail part of a 1990s redevelopment Hot Metal Bridge Pittsburgh US Gazing at the Golden Triangle the city s gleaming downtown at the confluence of two rivers it s hard to imagine that the view used to be disrupted by the noise and fumes of ladle cars loaded with molten iron They once chugged along this steel truss bridge to processing mills on the other side Pittsburgh was as James Parton said in 1868 hell with the lid off The bridge was reborn in 2007 with a smooth new roadway decorative railings and an eye catching LED installation at either end Ambitious cyclists take note this bridge is a pivotal piece in the 316 mile bike route that runs from Pittsburgh to D C Nesciobrug Amsterdam Netherlands This suspension bridge connects IJburg a new district on reclaimed land to central Amsterdam and a lovely waterfront park Despite its no cars policy Nesciobrug functions as a key component of the city s transportation system Stretching 2 559 feet over the Amsterdam Rhine Canal it splits in two at each leafy bank the forks add structural stiffness and create separate approach paths for bicyclists and pedestrians The main span of the bridge was dropped in place by a crane and installed within 12 hours the Amsterdam Rhine canal an important shipping artery couldn t be closed for any longer The High Line NY US Originally built in the 1930s as an elevated freight train bridge the High Line reopened in 2009 as a pedestrian only floating park above Manhattan stretching from Gansevoort Street in the Meatpacking District to 30th Street Eventually the park will extend all the way to 34th Street The High Line is a prime street food spot Artisanal ice pop makers People s Pops and La Newyorkina for instance dish out their icy treats in flavors such as mango chili and hibiscus during summer 2011 Gateshead Millennium Bridge Gateshead England Sure this bridge is popular with pedestrians and bicyclists who use it to cross between the cities of Gateshead and Newcastle But it also draws crowds of onlookers who want to witness its ingenious design the bridge tilts upward when boats pass underneath on the River Tyne The Gateshead is the first and only tilting bridge so far in the world Valley of the Giants Tree Top Walk Walpole Nornalup National Park Australia This lightweight but sturdy metal bridge lets those who aren t scared of heights explore the canopy of giant tingle trees from 130 feet above the forest floor It s within the Walpole Nornalup National Park a four and a half hour drive south of Perth Tingle trees are some of the world s largest trees and unique to this corner of Australia Te Rewa Rewa Bridge New Plymouth NZ Opened in 2010 in a corner of the North Island of New Zealand this bridge crosses the Waiwhakaiho River and brings to mind both a large white wave and a bleached whale skeleton The bridge provides easier access to the northern riverbank for fishers and surfers The bridge is aligned to perfectly frame Mount Taranaki a nearby volcano within its whalebone like arches Liberty Bridge in Falls Park Greenville SC US A travelandleisure com reader s comment drew our attention to this bridge which has futuristic curves and a support system that are unusual for the U S A single suspension cable and two 90 foot tall masts that lean away from the curved footpath at a 15 degree angle support this 345 foot long lightweight bridge making it appear to float on air Enjoy the expansive view of the Reedy River Falls where Greenville s first European settler Richard Pearis set up his trading post in the 18th century The Bridge of Peace Tbilisi Georgia Italian architect Michel De Lucchi and French lighting director Philippe Martinaud joined forces to create this futuristic bridge opened in 2010 This structure is topped by an undulating web like canopy of glass and iron and was commissioned by the government of Tbilisi to add a contemporary landmark to their city The Bridge of Peace spans the Mtkvari River connecting the historic district of Old Tbilisi with an up and coming district Pedro e In\\\\u00eas Bridge Coimbra Portugal From the banks of the Rio Mondego it appears that the bridge snapped in half at the middle and is in a precarious position Designed by engineer Cecil Balmond the bridge is actually made up of two cantilevered walkways joined in the middle by a zigzagging platform The bridge is named for Pedro and In\\\\u00eas two star crossed 14th century lovers whose affair ended tragically Seonimgyo Bridge Jeju Island South Korea Seven white nymphs playing musical instruments decorate each side of this bright red bridge over a waterfall on Jeju Island They ve earned the bridge its nickname Chilseonyeogyo meaning seven nymphs Legend has it that these seven nymphs descended from heaven at night to take a dip in the waterfall Esplanade Riel Winnipeg Manitoba Canada This cable stayed pedestrian bridge over the Red River connecting the neighborhoods of The Forks and St Boniface is most notable for the Salisbury House restaurant part of a chain of local diners which sits smack in the middle of it Signature dishes at the Salisbury House include Nip its version of a hamburger and grilled hot dogs called Winni Dogs But surely the unobstructed views of the river and downtown Winnipeg will be more memorable than the food Tree Top Canopy Walk Sabah Borneo Strung between five enormous trees in the rainforest this suspension bridge spans nearly 1 000 feet and stands about 85 feet at its highest point Admire the beautiful green canopy of the 130 million year old jungle from the large viewing platforms situated about halfway up the trunks of these massive trees In order to protect the trees the walkway was designed so that steel cables didn t have to be rigged directly into the trunks

       "  u'{title:The 6 Main Reasons Why Most Pro Athletes Go Broke ,body:When I was a young basketball player the thought of getting paid millions of dollars to play the sport I loved would quicken my heart rate and keep me up nights wishing upon a star As is true with most young athletes signing that contract with the NBA NFL or the MLB is a dream even more exciting than winning the lottery You work for 10 years retire in your 30s and you re financially set for the rest of your life What I discovered about the truth of the matter was incredibly shocking Similar to lottery winners with no financial prowess or discipline most pro athletes go completely broke in less than 10 years after retirement In fact 60 of retired basketball players go broke in 5 and 78 of football players in 2 Athletes are forced to sell their homes sell their championship rings and file for bankruptcy How does this happen How does achieving every little leaguer s dream turn into every regular Joe s nightmare As you will see the answer is simple just like lottery winners if you don t know how to legitimately make a million dollars you will have no idea how to keep a million dollars The following is a breakdown of where the money went and who has gone broke Bad Investments While many athletes had the right idea they made many mistakes when it came to investing their millions Rather than follow the more conservative path allocating small percentages to things like private equity and real estate making clever small business grants and watching it grow Instead of dedicating most of their attention to quality stocks and mutual funds most athletes do the complete opposite With little to no interest in the stock market they invest most of their money in sexier ventures like restaurants car dealerships and clothing lines all of which go belly up Here are some examples of investments gone horribly wrong Players NFL retirees Drew Bledsoe and Rick MirerVenture Pay By Touch a technology which would replace credit cards with fingerprints Result Company was sketchy to begin with riddled with legal issues and eventually closed down Player NFL s Muhsin MuhammadVenture Baylo Entertainment companyResult Muhammad had to sell his mansion on eBay when his company was being sued for late credit card payments Player MLB s Mike PelfreyVenture Texan financier Robert Allen Stanbford s 8 billion fraud Result 99 of his fortune is now frozen Player NFL s Raghib Rocket IsmailVentures Religious movie Rock N Roll Caf\\\\u00e9 COZ Records cosmetics framed calligraphy name shops Result All were flops millions of dollars up in smoke Player NFL s Michael VicVentures Car rental dealership real estate wine shopResult Never took off placing Vic 6 million in the hole forcing him to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and to put his mansion on the market Of course going to prison for illegal dog fighting pretty much took care of any endorsement deals he had Player Torii HunterVenture A new inflatable raft invention that you can place under your furniture where in the case of a flood everything floats Results Project sank 70 000 gone Hunter was nearly swindled into another 500 000 but he sought financial advice and was steered away from rubber dingys Hopefully he ll be wiser with his 90 million dollar contract Frivolous Spending Athletes in the big leagues spend like they re in the gargantuan leagues This is especially true for rookies who feel the pressure to maintain the same lifestyle as a veteran Mansions cars jewellery and clothes are bought at an absurd level during a pro athlete s peak earning period When a 22 year old is suddenly getting pay checks in the ballpark of 500 000 every two weeks the idea of remaining somewhat conservative while planning for the future seems ludicrous They find themselves purchasing 10 million dollar homes 10 cars of at least 125 000 apiece fancy restaurants and all night parties not to mention the drugs the alcohol and the gambling that is often associated with some of these rich celebrities They fail to realize that once the income stops the monthly payments don t Misplaced Trust As soon as these new professional athletes sign their names on the dotted line they are surrounded by vultures in the disguise of investors financial advisors and even friends and family who would tell them how to protect and spend their fortunes They ll be approached by all types of services who want to help them out but who will charge them up the yin yang for the privilege Some examples are the bill paying services who ll manage the athletes monthly expenses but who will charge their own monthly expense of 5000 Or financial managers who ll charge them 100 000 to prepare their taxes While the players are busy on the court or in the field they have no clue what is happening in their own bank accounts and most couldn t be bothered to find out so they hire people to take care of that stuff for them Unfortunately these people are very often crooked Between 1999 and 2002 42 million dollars was lost when approximately 78 NFL players trusted crooked advisors Luigi DiFonzo Former felon turned adviser defrauded many players including Eric Dickerson a Hall of Fame running back Luigi committed suicide in 2000 William Black An agent whose pyramid scheme took 15 million from over a dozen football players Kirk Wright The hedge fund manager managed to defraud folks from all walks of life to the tune of 150 million 4 million came from safety Blaine Bishop while 2 7 million came from safety Steve Atwater After being convicted of 47 counts of fraud and money laundering Kirk Wright would also commit suicide Divorce Between 60 80 of professional athlete marriages end in divorce No athlete in history understands the financial cost of divorce like Michael Jordan When all was said and done the former NBA superstar handed over 168 million to his ex wife Juanita placing him ahead of Neil Diamond and Steven Spielberg for the most expensive celebrity divorce Thankfully Jordan didn t waste all his money on things like inflatable furniture rafts and shady investment deals so while the settlement is indeed a huge blow to the bank account the six time NBA champion s endorsements and business deals will keep him out of the poor house Not all players are so fortunate Most professional athlete divorces occur after retirement when the pay checks are no longer coming in And in accordance with American divorce law the wife is entitled to half of the husband s assets including everything he earned during his sports career Children Diapers for one baby are expensive Professional athletes have a bad reputation for making many babies with many different mothers Monthly child support payments definitely add up Boxer Evander Holyfield It is estimated that Holyfield made over 200 million during his fighting career Now he s being sued for missing the 3000 per month payments for only one of his 11 children His 10 million dollar home is up for auction due to foreclosure NBA s Kenny Anderson 7 children from 5 different mothers 3 girlfriends and 2 wives One of these women divorced Kenny and won nearly half his assets close to 10 000 in child support and the license plate on her car reads HISCASH NBA s Sean Kemp 7 children 6 women NFL s Travis Henry 9 women 9 children At roughly 3000 a pop his monthly child support payments are equivalent to what some people earn in a year Entourage One problem with becoming incredibly wealthy is that you usually do it alone If you suddenly won the lottery it would be perfectly normal for you to want to take all your friends on an all inclusive trip around the world The only problem is that they didn t win the lottery They still have jobs to go to and bills to pay What ends up happening with many celebrities is they ll hire their friends to perform the various jobs accountants lawyers marketing managers required to keep their s t together while they re playing ball While this may seem like the right thing to do these friends aren t necessarily qualified to handle million dollar accounts or high profile real estate deals Mistakes are made millions of dollars are lost Many athletes turn to former NBA legend Magic Johnson for business advice and he will literally hang up on them if they ve hired a friend or a family member to handle their affairs And of course lets not forget the friends and family who come out of the woodwork as soon as these athletes sign that pro contract All of them are probably looking for a quick business loan because they know a guy who can make them all a little richer Suddenly your cousin s girlfriend s doctor s yoga instructor went to elementary school with you and they need your help Sounds absurd but any celebrity will contest that they often can t tell they re real friends apart from the people just looking for handouts once they became famous Also when someone you ve known for your entire life starts asking for a few thousand dollars and you ve just received your pay check for 500 000 it becomes difficult to say no Most athletes have known several people their entire lives ,url:cosmoloan money management the 6

       "  u'{title:delightful country cookin crispy chocolate log ,body:This past weekend my husband was throwing his good friend a bachelor party When he asked me to make those rice crispy chocolate things I immediately said yes This is one of my favorite dessert snacks because it s so easy to make and tastes absolutely amazing I got this recipe back in high school Our Spanish teacher was also the cheerleading coach and a rather unlikely one at that so she would sell baked goods to her Spanish classes in order to raise money for the cheerleaders As a Spanish student I gained probably 5 pounds that year just due to my consumption of these crispy chocolate treats alone I managed to track down the parent who donated the goodies and persuade her to give me the recipe Start by lining a large cookie sheet or jelly roll pan with parchment paper I ve also used wax paper but it doesn t work nearly as well Spray the paper heavily with cooking spray In a large microwave safe mixing bowl drop in 1 4 cup of peanut butter optional 1 4 cup margarine or butter and an entire bag of large marshmallows Microwave on high for 2 3 minutes until your marshmallows get nice and puffy Then stir it all down making sure to mix the peanut butter and margarine in with the marshmallows YUM Mix into your marshmallows approximately 5 1 2 cups of crisp rice cereal until coated and then spread in your prepared pan I find the best method for spreading the marshmallowy mess is to run cold water over my hands before patting the mixture down no stick And now I need to take a detour from the recipe to explain to you why I love these so much it s the bowl There is no way possible to get all of the marshmallowy rice crispies out of the bowl and onto that pan There are only two possible solutions for this problem either I just put the bowl in the sink as it is or I eat what is left inside Can you guess which option I picked Unfortunately for me my husband also had the same idea I had my back turned for one minute and the next thing I know the entire contents of the bowl are gone and his face is covered in marshmallow Men Now on to the part of the recipe that really makes these goodies shine Mix 3 4 cup butterscotch chips and 1 1 3 cups chocolate chips in a microwave safe mixing bowl Microwave on high 2 3 minutes stopping at least every minute to stir until the chips are melted Do not let these cook for the full 2 3 minutes without stirring or you ll get burnt chocolate and nobody wants that Spread the melted chocolate over the top of the rice crispy mixture getting it as close to the edges as you can After you re done with that you ll want to lick the chocolate bowl I made sure he didn t steal that one Pick up the parchment paper on one of the long ends and start to roll into a log Keep rolling until it looks like this Once it s rolled position it so that it is seam side down and then chill for at least one hour to allow the chocolate to set Finally cut into slices and enjoy This is one of those easy to make recipes that is perfect to individually wrap and then put in lunch boxes or take on road trips I encourage you to serve them chilled there s just something wonderful about biting into a chewy rice crispy layer before hitting the cool candy bar center In order to make these lower fat try cutting the margarine down by half and cutting down or completely omitting the peanut butter It won t turn these into health food but it will leave you with a much lighter dessert without compromising the flavor Crispy Chocolate Log1 4 cup margarine1 4 cup peanut butter1 bag large marshmallows5 1 2 cups crisped rice cereal1 1 3 cups chocolate chips3 4 cups butterscotch chipsLine a large cookie sheet or jelly roll pan with parchment paper and spray heavily with

combine Add crisped rice cereal stirring until thoroughly coated Spread evenly into pan In a microwave safe bowl combine chocolate and butterscotch chips Microwave on high 2 3 minutes stirring at least every minute until melted stir Spread evenly over top of crisped rice mixture Lift up a long end of the parchment paper and roll dessert like a jelly roll until it forms a log Arrange so that

       "  u\"{title:Easy Thanksgiving Recipes and Tips Thanksgiving at Epicurious com ,body:Photography by Stephen Sullivan food and prop styling by Roscoe Betsill H osting your first holiday feast It can be daunting A menu of familiar dishes for which everyone will have expectations plus the pressure of executing a complicated meal in a timely manner can make even the most experienced cook wish someone else would take over But there s really no need for this trepidation Armed with good planning and some delicious dependable recipes you can calmly serve a wonderful holiday meal to friends and family I ve put together this menu of solid classics plus I ve shared tips drawn from my years of cooking teaching and writing about Thanksgiving Finally I ve added a shopping list and a timeline to help you pull everything off with ease Who knows even seasoned cooks might pick up a few pointers here tips for a smooth thanksgiving Build Your Skills Gradually How do you think Grandma got so good at cooking Thanksgiving Practice If you re just starting out there s absolutely no reason that every item on your menu has to be made by you from scratch Your first year focus on just the turkey stuffing and gravy have guests bring the other dishes be sure to coordinate what everyone s bringing so you end up with enough of everything Once you feel that you ve mastered these three essentials the next year branch out to some other dishes Before you know it you ll have experience with the entire menu Supplement From the Store In addition to having guests bring some dishes don t be afraid to purchase things to round out the meal The key to make it buy it success is getting top quality items Ask your cheesemonger to recommend an assortment of interesting cheeses for a simple delicious hors d oeuvre Find a good local bakery to supply crusty rolls for the main course and a fresh pumpkin pie to accompany the simple homemade apple cake You may spend a bit more but you ll save your sanity and if you find good sources the bought items can be as good as homemade Eventually as you build your skills you ll be able to branch out to making pies and breads from scratch In my humble opinion there is just too much food on the typical Thanksgiving table If I have spent hours in the kitchen I want my guests to be able to savor the fare not groan at the sight of food heaped on their plates With both stuffing and sweet potatoes on the table I see no need to serve mashed potatoes as well But if you can t bear to give them up feel free to add your favorite recipe to this menu Another tip to bear in mind Be careful not to have too many casseroles and other baked dishes that need last minute time in the oven A saut\\\\u00e9ed green vegetable such as the green beans in this menu can be cooked entirely on the stovetop and will be a welcome contrast to all the baked carbs Rely on Lists Not Your Memory There s no such thing as too many lists when it comes to a holiday meal For this menu I ve put together a grocery list and a timetable but you ll also want to decide which beverages to serve wine writer Linda Murphy has provided suggestions in the menu and add them to the list along with any sundries candles guest towels camera batteries or film etc If you can buy all nonperishables in the weeks before the holiday to avoid a last minute dash Other organizational tricks that will make things easier Label serving dishes with the items they ll hold and tape up a complete menu in the kitchen so you don t forget to serve something I m famous for forgetting the cranberry sauce in the refrigerator Thanksgiving is about hospitality and sometimes the guest list can get pretty big But this doesn t need to cause panic Just be sure that you have enough plates and utensils and if you don t have room for a seated meal do the menu as a buffet I ve offered recipes for eight servings but with the exception of the cake everything on the menu can easily be scaled up simply by multiplying the ingredients and using larger serving dishes For more than 12 guests make a second cake or add another dessert Tighten Up Your Bar Selection It takes time to make individual cocktails and time is not something you ll have a lot of if you re hosting Thanksgiving Consider serving a single house cocktail Murphy s suggestion a Neo Politan uses an infused syrup that can be made well ahead of time and is easy to mix up For nondrinkers replace the vodka with seltzer Or simplify things by just combining vodka or seltzer with cranberry juice With the meal the wines recommended for each course will keep things interesting but you could also serve the same wine throughout the entire meal a full bodied Pinot Noir or Chardonnay would pair perfectly well with everything on the menu Rick Rodgers is a cooking teacher and the author of Thanksgiving 101 50 Best Stuffings Dressings and more than 20 other titles read a beginner's thanksgiving -

       "  u\"{title:Here s why you ll never yell taxi again in NYC USATODAY com here's why you'll never yell 'taxi' again in nyc,body:A new smartphone application called ZabKab launched earlier this week that allows users to hail a yellow taxicab using their smartphone Basically the app allows users to broadcast their GPS location to taxi drivers who are also using the application Users tap the hail button on the app which sends out their location and then the cabs in the area will begin to appear on the map in the application for users to view ZabKab users can also opt to include additional information to send to the cab driver like how many people are in their party and if they need a cab that is wheelchair accessible While Zabkab isn t the first car service app it is significant because it allows users to hail NYC yellow taxicabs Other car service apps like Uber use private cars to provide service to customers Developing an application for NYC yellow taxi cabs is a little bit tricky because of Taxi Limousine Commission regulations TLC The TLC requires Medallion taxi drivers to only pick up hailing passengers The drivers cannot be a part of a dispatch system or pre arrange taxi services So naturally this presents a little bit of a challenge when trying to create an app that is supposed to make it easier to find a cab ZabKab however does not offer a pre arranged service but rather allows taxis to see where customers are The TLC also prohibits the Medallion taxi drivers from using a mobile device while they are driving a passenger but the new application addresses this by only allowing the driver to view the app display when the car is at a standstill When the cab starts to move the app display fades away ZabKab was developed by Flatiron Apps a New York City based company and while they launched their app in NYC the company plans to roll out the application to other U S cities and international cities according to their website ZabKab is free for those trying to find a taxi and is available on the iPhone iPad and Android mobile devices A version for the BlackBerry will be available soon Cab drivers however must pay 14 95 a month for the service after an initial free 45 day trial period More from CNBC comWill Starbucks Square take mobile payments mainstream Gadgets for the one percent Dropbox spam attack blamed on another website s breach 2012 CNBC com hailing a taxi in new york city just got a little bit easier thanks to zabkab app. hailing a taxi in new york city just got a little bit easier thanks to zabkab app.,url:usatoday tech products story 2012 08 09 cnbc taxi app 56936636 1}\",\n",

       "  u'{title:100 Hardest Hits in Sports History 100 hardest hits in sports history,body:100 What You Talkin Bout Willis This hit should stifle the Jets return game Brad Smith takes a nice hug from arguably the best middle linebacker in the game after Ray Lewis Maybe it s a good idea to keep Smith in the Wildcat formation 99 Filling the Lane This may just seem like a solid form tackle but Chris Henry s career began to significantly go downhill afterwards Darrell Reid filled the lanes nicely and let loose Henry may stick to the outside next time 98 Pummeled Princess This high school s homecoming princess was just looking for her glass shoe She eventually found it in her dreams as she was completely knocked out It s moves like this that give cheerleaders the airhead reputation 97 Takes One to Know One While we usually see fearless safety Ed Reed punish receivers with these kinds of hits he is on the wrong end of this one Hines Ward known as one of the best run blocking receivers in the game doesn t hesitate when he has to get the job done And he always does 96 The Hit That Cost Millions This is why coaches need to avoid sending 180 pound receivers on crossing routes Browns receiver Mohamed Massaquoi looks like he felt this hit repeatedly during these two minutes This was one of the first hits that tarnished James Harrison s reputation He s just doing his job 95 Trainer Camp Hopefully Colorado has an assistant trainer because this one won t be able to treat himself after this flop He s a warrior though as he shakes it off and congratulates the receiver Maybe they need a dugout on those sidelines 94 Long Hair Don t Care Maybe Bills receiver Steve Johnson should ve blamed God for this hit and not for his famous dropped pass against the Steelers Troy Polamalu continues to make it clear that he is the most versatile safety in the league He can probably throw the ball too 93 His Body Fails Him While this is known as the play that forced Kurt Warner to retire it is also the proof that quarterbacks should never play defense Thank you Bobby McCray for presenting us with this aesthetically pleasing brand of blocking You can always tell a good hit when the victim is lifted off the ground both feet in the air is key 92 A Slice of Kimbo Take it like a man This guy apparently got 50 to receive this hit from the beloved Kimbo Slice Perfect form tackle 91 Brown Nosed After Auburn s Junior Rosegreen knocked out Georgia s Reggie Brown it appeared that the hit was malicious In the end Rosegreen was probably jealous that Brown was going into the NFL Brown had a solid five year career with the Philadelphia Eagles racking up more than 2 500 yards Then he began to remember this hit and lost his confidence He is now on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers attempting to reinvent himself 90 It s All About Heart Time to give the high schoolers their well deserved credit In this game between Bakersfield High School and Grant High School this cornerback had one thing in mind They both performed acrobatic acts while airborne 89 This Is Playoff Football The 2007 AFL Playoffs featured a plethora of hard hits but none better than this Chicago Rush DB Dennison Robinson let it all out on Avengers WR Kevin Ingram in the Divisional Round game Just showing their worth to the NFL we get it 88 Crikey That is one tough punter The former Australian rules footballer joined the Eagles in 2007 becoming the oldest rookie in NFL history This was the ultimate cheap shot but he can seemingly take a hit 87 Naked Is Not Natural He may not have clothes on but this streaker has plenty of fashionable bruises after this hit It s baffling as to why a man would run naked on a field with 300 pound behemoths waiting to attack at the first sign of blood All one can do is shake his head 86 When Two Trees Collide This is the result of a redwood hitting an oak tree full speed In 2007 on this fateful night Dion Phaneuf 6 3 214 pounds had his sights set on the Flames Derek Boogaard 6 7 265 pounds Put that on sports science 85 Blades of Gory Hockey is the perfect combination of football and figure skating Dion Phaneuf again ruins an opponent s hopes and dreams Just an innocent player dumping the puck into the opposite zone The perfect victim 84 Jagerbomb Alex Ovechkin is known as arguably the most potent scorer in the league but he s strong in every aspect of his game He lays bone crunching hits on opponents whenever the opportunity opens up Jaromir Jagr is just another notch on the belt 83 The Freight Train Myrtle Beach Pelicans first baseman Kala Ka aihue became ecstatic as he came around third during this game in 2007 He must ve done something right because he was draft by the Kansas City Royals in the 15th round His reaction time might have been crippled with this hit as he has been a 216 career hitter 82 Shattered Glass If this doesn t seem vicious to you check out the broken glass that shatters all over the ice Hopefully the NHL boards are a scosche stronger So much for a professional career for this player Referring to the hitter he may get arrested 81 Sky Rockets in Flight 6 4 defenseman Cory Sarich now on the Calgary Flames takes no prisoners to say the least If this was the Olympics he would win the baton twirling competition His opponent did always dream of flying 80 Quite a Ruutu Hit Tuomo Ruutu makes his second appearance on this list as he upends thick defenseman Kris Letang He s off his feet helmet in air and hands flailing Perfect 79 Cruel and Unusual Punishment This was a slow and painful death Fresno State s Paul Williams was a lame duck after this hit by Oregon s J D Nelson Williams was in immediate shock followed by a slow crawl to the floor 78 NHL Villain New York Islanders fans remember Darcy Tucker for his subtly obvious cheap shot on center Michael Peca He s still up to his classless ways Darcy Tucker attempts to remove Sami Kapanen s head Tucker only attacks those who aren t ready 77 Two for One Nobody won in this collision This was a match between the Collinsville Kahoks and the Belleville West Maroons One player decided to go airborne and hit the ground head first and the other essentially got decked 76 The Price Is Right These NHLers look for any reason to start a fight and this is just another example Cam Janssen goes to grab the puck and Montreal Canadiens goalie Carey Price tries to beat him to the punch literally Mayhem ensues 75 A Mays Ing Keep in mind that former USC safety Taylor Mays is a 6 3 safety who weighs 230 pounds Drafted by the San Francisco 49ers for his fearless attitude and stellar tackling skills amidst concerns about his pass coverage ability Mays is a man among children at the safety position Receivers in college thought twice 74 Airborne Brian Campbell gets some significant air with this explosion reaching three feet off the ground Ryan Malone on the other hand ends up on the floor with a slammed posterior Somebody always gets hurt 73 Blown Fuse One of the most feared tacklers of all time especially from the safety position Lynch put everything into each hit Electric return man Dante Hall wasn t quite prepared to be lifted off the ground Not elusive enough this time 72 And Twins This is two for the price of one Those two players believe in special teams and they do everything to help their return man Stars on each of their helmets this week 71 Not in My House Keep your head up Sure he s got balls but this is almost more stupidity than anything else Tuomo Ruutu of the Carolina Hurricanes lets Christoph Schubert of the Ottawa Senators know that he needs to stay in his own end 70 Stop Drop and Roll Whenever a player is flailing to gain possession of the ball for more than one third of a second he is bound to get leveled This poor running back learns it the hard way Next time he ll just drop to the ground 69 This Is a Man s Game At first you feel bad for the kid but once he starts crying it s time to move on He s fine get him an ice pack and some signed footballs This may explain a lot down the line though 68 National Security Bengals fans miss the sight of this man throwing the ball or maybe they don t Either way we know this security guard sure doesn t It s too typical that Terrell Owens wouldn t help the man up 67 The Peko of Contact Troy Polamalu s face on the bench following this block says it all Defensive lineman Domata Peko was being used as a blocker to help his Cincinnati Bengals score during this Monday Night Football game The safety didn t even see it coming 66 Just Another Day at the Office No receiver in the league probably deserves this more than T O The pretentious chatty wideout finally gets shut up with this crushing blow Troy Polamalu continues to impress 65 He Went Downie Hard This occurred in the preseason so you know the NHL doesn t mess around Flyer Steve Downie thought he was safe wrapping around the net Dean McAmmond had something to say about that 64 T O Stands for Totally out The Oakland Raiders definitely miss Charles Woodson at cornerback After winning a Super Bowl with the Green Bay Packers Woodson can look back on this video and smile T O goes down extremely hard for a 6 3 behemoth 63 A Bruising Defensive Lineman It took a few years for NFL defenses to figure out how to tackle this defensive lineman who lines up at running back The 6 4 Jacobs is quite the physical specimen and has proved at 264 pounds that he can run through the toughest defenders with ease Brian Urlacher might go for the knees next time 62 Landry Time Watch out for Washington safety Laron Landry in the future While he is known as a ball hawking safety Landry loves to destroy approaching ball carriers At least there s one bright spot on the Redskins 61 Beastly Patrick Willis continues to impress as he performs the perfect form tackle on this poor running back Next time keep it to the outside Maybe Reggie Bush knows something we don t 60 Bush Turns to Grass If Saints fans ever start to miss Reggie Bush all they need to do is look at this list Bush gets destroyed by the zealous Patrick Willis Stick to the bench kid 59 Hall Pass The first overall pick of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft got a nice welcoming into the league with this hit by the Kings Drew Doughty All the Edmonton Oilers players rush to the protection of their young savior Such loyalty 58 Lacrosse Can Compete Who says lacrosse can t compete with football for hardest hits Well we do but this is still ridiculous As he was staring to the right side of the field running carelessly with the ball it was clear his day was going to end soon 57 A Game of Inches Always keep your head up when chasing the ball carrier The future looks bleak for this player as he sprints upfield One moment later it s over 56 The Start of Redemption 55 Human Flatbread Blake Comeau is victimized for the second time in this list The Penguins Max Talbot completely lifts the Islanders 6 0 left wing off his feet Time for Comeau to start looking around before skating 54 The Other Great One Fans don t understand how difficult that is The commentators were clearly impressed but what made it better was Alex Ovechkin s stare afterwards He s a heartless killer 53 Cooked to Perfection Los Angeles King Dustin Brown is known as a hard hitter Matt Cooke is on the wrong end of this as he is depleted To add insult to injury he gets a mouthful of elbow 52 Running into a Kronwall Swedish defenseman Niklas Kronwall unleashes this travesty in 2009 When they feet end up higher than the head there s a problem That s a real wake up call 51 Bruising Bruin While this occurred in 2008 these are the types of plays that led the Boston Bruins to a Stanley Cup victory in 2011 Defenseman Milan Lucic known as an elite player at his position loves to bring fear to his opponents Toughness 50 Rookie Treatment Currently a defenseman for the New Jersey Devils Anton Volchenkov is 235 pounds of fearlessness As much as it hurts to post a video of John Tavares being rudely welcomed into the league it s too good to ignore Tavares is still the next great star 49 Going for the Hed Man The second overall pick of the 2009 NHL Draft was displeased with his treatment during this game Anton Volchenkov must hate the 2009 draft considering he demolished the first two picks in succession Hedman a 6 6 defenseman who weighs 230 pounds is ousted in this one It s the size of the fight in the dog 48 He ll Feel This Until Mays Many scouts and fans believe that Taylor Mays will be the next Ronnie Lott Well he s clearly got the tackling part down as he gives tight end Craig Stevens a nice gift Perfect every time 47 The Destroyer Take it easy on the Isles they re just a bunch of kids The seventh pick of the 2006 NHL Draft Kyle Okposo becomes a helicopter following this hit from bruising defenseman Dion Phaneuf Okposo had to be carted off after laying motionless for six minutes 46 Clutterbucked Cal Clutterbuck quickly gaining fame for his checking ability has been among the best hitters in the league statistically In 2009 he broke Dustin Brown s record for most hits in a season with 356 That s slightly over four concussions a game for his opponents 45 The Real King Brown is quickly becoming one of the biggest hitters in the NHL Watching him upend the check hungry Dion Phaneuf is enough to bring fans to his side No hesitation 44 The Hunter Call this man the James Harrison of the NHL When he sets his sights on his prey it s all but over His tactics are in line with a cheetah chasing a gazelle Yeah that sounds about right 43 The Kariyan War Scott Stevens was a brutal defenseman during his days patrolling the blue line for the Devils Paul Kariya wasn t quite the Mighty Duck on this night as he gets absolutely crushed Kariya s career naturally began to go down hill after this 42 Good Old Stevens Round 2 of the 1999 2000 NHL playoffs featured this beautiful hit by Scott Stevens In Game 6 tempers were flaring and Stevens needed to set the tone That hit just about did it 41 He s Dunn Welcome to the big leagues kid Indians catcher Carlos Santana in only his third game starting in the major leagues gets leveled by 6 6 first baseman Adam Dunn as the gargantuan is gingerly jogging down the line Luckily for Santana Dunn wasn t running full speed 40 Marchmenting All over His Opponents Bryan Marchment nailed fellow tough guy Donald Brashear in this epic moment Brashear is normally the one starting fights but check artist Bryan Marchment beats him to the punch here as he tosses his opponent to the floor with fury Brashear spends the rest of the game instigating but it was too late 39 Multi Talented And he can hit Terrell Davis despite being a sixth round pick could do everything This hit on special teams opened up his teammates eyes He should ve played linebacker 38 Head to Head Nothing is worse than a brutal head to head collision like this Rugby players don t use pads so you know they re tough On the other hand many football fans believe that if this hit was between NFL players without pads they d be in a coma That s a fair assessment 37 Harder Potter It can t be denied that these rugby players know how to tackle Rugby seems like the perfect combination of Quidditch and football Time to start watching this vicious sport 36 Wacked by the Tonga This sport keeps getting better These players have no fear considering they re vulnerable every time the ball is in the air Every hit is a highlight including this one by Willie Tonga 35 The Spear If this youth continues to lead with his head he will be out of football before high school Keep your head up and shoulders squared The rest falls into place Ignoring fundamentals this kid got jacked up 34 Run over by a Truck Virginia Tech s Darren Evans saw a hole and hit it hard He wasn t going to let anyone get in his way especially a puny and timid defensive back He flattens him to mere unimportance Another confidence booster 33 Head Hunting This is the true definition of head hunting The defender hit nothing but the head of this Clemson University receiver While the helmet went flying the player s head stayed in place He got lucky 32 The Terminator It s too perfect that this fullback is named John Connor The terminator is quite the bruiser for the New York Jets While Rex Ryan clearly loves him the fans began to see his physicality during Hard Knocks 31 What Football Wait there was football being played Naturally these Eagles cheerleaders garner all the attention until one crunching hit wakes everyone up These three players were too busy looking at the sideline to focus on the ball 30 Blind Ambition Virginia Tech tight end Greg Boone was just being a great teammate on this play blocking for speedy receiver Eddie Royal now on the Denver Broncos This Duke player will think twice about blindly chasing the ball carrier next time 29 The Chancellor Virginia Tech defender Kam Chancellor shows us why arm tackles are unnecessary A solid shoulder is all that is needed as he destroys this Florida State running back The sidelines are a dangerous place 28 Block of the Year Miami s Jordan Futch nails Georgia Tech s Steven Sylvester with this ridiculous blindside block Nothing excites a team or its fans more than a vicious legal block Full speed no hesitation 27 Koval Gets Chuked Three hundred sixty nine career goals couldn t prepare Ilya Kovalchuk for this hit It s only a matter of time before you re put on the Most Wanted list Defensemen eventually get tired of being scored on 26 Flying Like a Hawkins When he was on the Philadelphia Eagles safety Brian Dawkins was feared by receivers around the league for his hard hitting prowess Alge Crumpler at 6 2 and 275 pounds was just another victim Dawkins didn t let anybody cross through his area 25 A Tad Soon Carolina Panther Dante Wesley was only slightly early with this hit Not only was the ball only at the peak of its flight on the way to the returner but Wesley went straight for his head He was eventually suspended for one game 24 The Man the Legend Clemson s David Dunham didn t care that Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan was a top prospect in the 2008 NFL Draft and the potential No 1 pick And he definitely let him know as Ryan s helmet was vigorously thrown in the air with this hit The hit didn t affect Ryan too much though as he s led the Atlanta Falcons back to postseason promise in his three seasons 23 Time for a Dentist Appointment Hits into the boards like this are why hockey players have a reputation for lacking teeth Going into the glass numerous times can increase medical bills significantly This is just another trip to the dentist for Fedor Tyutin after Matt Cooke unleashes this dirty hit 22 In the Crosshairs Dallas Cowboys safety Roy Williams doesn t seem to care that Todd Heap has 5 492 yards in his career he just wants blood Nothing excites these defensive backs more than a vulnerable receiver crossing the middle It never gets boring 21 Send Him Some Flowers Brandon Flowers a cornerback on the Kansas City Chiefs was taken in the second round of the 2008 NFL Draft but that was after he showed scouts his toughness with this hit While on Virginia Tech he saw a receiver vulnerable in the open field Hunting season 20 Losing His Jersey Ryan Wilson causes T J Oshie s jersey to wrap around on this one The midsection is always the most vulnerable spot which is why Wilson crunches Oshie so roughly We ve got a bleeder 19 He ll Need a Wooden Kane Since being the fourth overall pick of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft Evander Kane no relation to Patrick has been a spark plug and playmaker for the Atlanta Thrashers Now that they have moved to Winnipeg to become the Jets Kane can start anew and improve his tough reputation This was just Sean O Donnell welcoming the youngster to the league 18 Mental Aptitude In the 2008 All Star game between Texas and The Nation Oklahoma State s Rodrick Johnson laid out Lambuth University s Allen Ervin on this seemingly routine run There s nothing better than a safety who stops the run It s all in the mentality 17 He s Going to Parrish Nothing gets under the skin of a defensive player more than a 5 9 receiver who eludes every extended arm thrown their way This Florida State player sees the opportunity for revenge After the ball squeaks through Roscoe Parrish s hands he becomes vulnerable and defeated 16 Get on My Level Just listen to the background music after the hit it couldn t be more perfect Canadian defenseman Dion Phaneuf got his tough reputation with hits like this He ends Czech Republic s Rostislav Olesz s game early during the semifinal matchup at the 2004 World Junior Championships 15 Get Bucked and Cluttered It brings joy to fans hearts when teammates defend each other after one of them is abused like this Cal Clutterbuck holds nothing back in this hit on Brad Richards At 31 years old Richards is a crafty veteran and he didn t even see this coming 14 Light at the End of the Tunnel He s not going to pass the spelling test tomorrow morning The defender may have speared the vulnerable receiver but it s the quarterback s fault for leading him towards death They ll be working on that play next week 13 Sharing Is Caring This was a BCS Championship so clearly emotions were flying Florida s safety Major Wright tells Oklahoma receiver Manny Johnson that he is not willing to share his territory Get out of his house 12 Oh Poe Everything looks more epic in slow motion In this game between Enumclaw and Kentwood a vicious block was let loose Linebacker T J Poe made sure this receiver wouldn t be able to chase the intercepted ball Naturally went on to play linebacker for Washington University 11 Most Powerful Body Check Ever This might be the best body check of all time Open ice hits are clearly overrated as Larry Robinson crushes his opponent through the glass The boards are just there for reminders but they are meant to be broken 10 Caught in the Moment Oklahoma State s Quinton Moore has no sympathy for Arkansas receivers clearly Coaches gasp every time their quarterbacks throw over the middle This is often bound to happen 9 Running over a Hill Not running out of bounds was the worst decision quarterback Russell Hill could ve possibly made While we commend the toughness he needs to protect his life Jeron Johnson had no qualms about closing off the sideline 8 Ray Being Ray It is natural to see a recurring theme on this list Ray Ray This highlight reel s tackles are never bereft of malicious vigor His hit here is performed on 242 pound fullback Ahmard Hall Fearless 7 The Ultimate Warrior The NFL and its fans surely miss the ball hawking safety R I P Sean Taylor and his elite athleticism and crunching hits Ironically this hit came during the Pro Bowl which is known for its friendly loose style of play It s amazing that punter Brian Moormon has the stability to get up from this hit and find Taylor to congratulate him 6 This Punter Has Game This 6 3 230 pound punter might as well be a linebacker Before being drafted by the Steelers out of Baylor in 2007 he showed off his skills on this North Texas returner He forgot to keep his head up despite performing a nice spear 5 The Size of the Fight in the Dog Brian Campbell is a 6 0 defenseman who weighs less than 190 pounds and he could care less He stops a bigger center in his tracks without hesitation Always have to root for the smaller kids 4 Keller s World Gets Rocked The effects of this hit become clear on the following play when Dustin Keller gets the ball on fourth down and steps out of bounds a few yards before the first down marker Another defender out of Miami University Ray Lewis has been an intimidating figure in the NFL for a long time and may go down as the best middle linebacker of all time At least the angriest 3 Ultimate Victory Surviving a hit from this friendly 5 8 safety will turn out to be one of Knowshon Moreno s biggest accomplishments This was a warm welcome into the NFL His career has yet to reach fruition considering the bruised psyche he has had to deal with This hit changed everything 2 Blackout This Texas A M defender leaves it all out on the field When announcers say the receiver was flattened this is what they are referring to Hopefully he likes mashed potatoes and smoothies because he ll be drinking out of a straw for a while 1 That s Bush Bush League Sheldon Brown has just earned our respect He didn t buy all the Reggie Bush hype and wanted to show his disapproval on the field After getting leveled that badly by a cornerback Bush should ve retired right there With his biggest weakness being his inability to run between the tackles Bush surely wasn t going to improve following this crushing blow rankings\\\\/list, multiple sports, cool lists while there has been ubiquitous concern regarding the vicious  hits that occur in football, fans undoubtedly love the bone-crushing  licks that athletes release on each other... while there has been ubiquitous concern regarding the vicious  hits that occur in football, fans

       "  u'{title:Why barefoot is best for children Life and style why barefoot is best for children,body:While Katie Holmes was vilified by the press and public alike for stepping out with her four year old daughter in high heels last year many of us wouldn t think twice about putting our kids in a dinky pair of mini me trainers But there s a growing belief among experts that when it comes to children s footwear the best shoe may be no shoe at all Tracy Byrne a podiatrist specialising in podopaediatrics believes that wearing shoes at too young an age can hamper a child s walking and cerebral development Toddlers keep their heads up more when they are walking barefoot she says The feedback they get from the ground means there is less need to look down which is what puts them off balance and causes them to fall down Walking barefoot she continues develops the muscles and ligaments of the foot increases the strength of the foot s arch improves proprioception our awareness of where we are in relation to the space around us and contributes to good posture We ve come to regard the way we dwell permanently in shoes as normal and natural says John Woodward an Alexander Technique teacher who has been barefoot for 25 years It s anything but True we are no longer hunter gatherers True our urban environments are full of unnatural dangers But we can still learn from our origins footwear was designed to protect the soles of the feet where necessary and it was temporary Byrne whose own two young children go unshod wherever possible offers free foot health checks for children from her East London based practice The more parents know about the structure of children s feet the more we can prevent footwear related damage being done she says What sort of damage Research published in podiatry journal The Foot in 2007 suggests that structural and functional changes can result from the foot having to conform to the shape and constriction of a shoe rather than being allowed to develop naturally And the younger the foot the greater the potential for damage Woodward illustrates the point perfectly describing an incident in a restaurant where he was dining sans shoes A four year old noticed my bare feet and taking the matter into her own hands took off her own shoes and socks he says On seeing this the girl s mother warned Put your shoes on because if you don t your feet will spread And then you won t be able to wear shoes at all The human foot at birth is not a miniature version of an adult foot In fact it contains no bones at all and consists of a mass of cartilage which over a period of years ossifies to become the 28 bones that exist in the adult human foot This process is not complete until the late teens so it is crucial that footwear when worn is well chosen Most children s shoes ought to come with a government health warning believes Byrne They are like awful little bricks too stiff too rigid with no flexibility at the sole and too much heel raise This is of particular concern with toddlers learning to walk because it causes them to bounce and tip forward she says Woodward agrees I have in my hand a Nike Air shoe for a three year old quite an expensive item I would guess From the heel to the toe there is no bend or give in the sole Completely rigid this shoe will restrict movement of the forefoot to zero Kids this age should be turning cartwheels skipping climbing trees running around A shoe like this would seriously restrict such playful physicality make it less fun less enjoyable Mike O Neill a consultant podiatrist and spokesperson for the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists believes that too many parents treat their children as fashion accessories and choose shoes on their attractiveness or coolness rather than their ergonomics Byrne agrees but points out that it s not just parents but manufacturers who have a responsibility People see particular shoe styles on sale in the shops whether it s a high heel for toddlers a Crawler a shoe for babies not yet walking or a cute Havaiana flip flop with no more than an elastic band at the back And they think Well if it s on the shelf it must be OK she says With the recent trend for barefoot running and the associated questioning of the need for highly cushioned supportive running shoes some parents may now be thinking a little more about their children s footwear or indeed whether they should encourage them to go barefoot From a functional perspective shoes shouldn t be necessary says O Neill In fact there are more likely to be disadvantages and problems from wearing shoes than not wearing them among them deformation caused by a poor fit ingrown toenails and athlete s foot But you have to consider the environment the child is in Let s be honest Do you want your child walking on the streets or in the park barefoot where there might be dog poo dirt and possible hazards like glass This is precisely the niche that a newly launched range of kids barefoot shoes Vivo Barefoot aims to fill Children get the health benefits of going barefoot with the protection of normal shoes says MD Galahad Clark who is a descendent of the shoemaking Clarks family The shoes with sizes ranging from 18 months the age from which most babies are walking to seven years are wide light and flexible with a 3mm puncture resistant sole The range was launched in South Africa last year under the name Froggies and research conducted there found that replacing seven to 12 year old children s normal school shoes for Froggies over a two month period resulted in increased foot strength balance mobility and ankle function the same benefits normally attributed to walking in bare feet The South African Podiatry Association has given the shoes their stamp of approval We want to get Vivos into schools in the UK before they write their rule books on black lace ups says Clark In an experimental scheme the company has already handed out free shoes to six to eight year olds at Denmead Preparatory school in Middlesex At least half the class are wearing these as their black school shoes says Joseph Johansen head of sport at the school The boys have commented on how much they like them that they feel lighter and more comfortable The Vivo Barefoot shoes tick all the boxes in Byrne s list of good shoe requirements a completely flexible sole a wide and deep toebox an anatomically correct last the mould that a shoe is built on a closure at the back and an adjustable closure at the top such as laces or Velcro As more and more evidence comes to light regarding the importance of going barefoot and the potential dangers of bad footwear the barefoot model will have to become more widely adopted by shoe manufacturers says Byrne So what about shoes for kids that haven t made it on to two feet yet According to O Neill their primary function is to provide warmth But Byrne believes they are a waste of money Crawling is an essential skill to master but it is very difficult when you are wearing pram shoes or Crawlers she says Crawling stimulates the brain to develop convergence of vision people who skip this phase as babies may find it extremely difficult to learn to read and write as children And in the case of children who crawl backwards to begin with shoes can put extra pressure on the structures of the foot and leg Clarks which produces Crawlers makes the following declaration on its website There s nothing better for young feet than walking barefoot whenever it s safe It helps muscles develop allows the skin to breathe and feeling the ground beneath their feet will help them learn to walk The title of this statement Barefoot is best most parents would balk at the idea of toddlers in high heels, but what about sandals or trainers? some experts now believe that all shoes are best avoided in childhood, says sam murphy most parents would balk at the idea of toddlers in high heels, but what about sandals

       "  u'{title:Mangio da Sola The Search for the Perfect Yellow Cake Part 6 ,body:Don t forget to sign up for the GIVEAWAY The deadline is Monday July 5th I think we found THE cake so far The recipe comes from the baker at Cake Love Warren Brown You may have seen him a long time ago on Food Network s Sugar Rush This cake was easy to put together I made three modifications based on previous cakes 1 I used 1 egg yolk plus 3 eggs instead of 4 whole eggs and 2 I used 6 oz of all purpose flour with 3 oz of cake flour 9oz total instead of 7oz of AP with 2 oz of potato starch 9oz total We plan to try out more yellow cake recipes but so far this one is my favorite Lydia thought I had put oil in it but it doesn t have a lick of oil in it The batter is AMAZING I would give the batter a 10 because I kept licking the beater and ended up licking the bowl and spoon once everything was in the oven and I have never done that with any of these yellow cakes THE GOOD The texture of the cake is soft light and fluffy yet it is sturdy enough to be used in a strawberry shortcake cake or something requiring a wet or moist filling It tastes close to but better than a cake mix cake in my opinion It isn t spongy or oily I would not call it moist however I wouldn t call it dry either It just has a perfect texture You could easily eat it without frosting like Warren Brown did in his video that I posted below In fact that is what I did with the fallen pieces of cake that didn t get frosted I would pair the chocolate frosting with a quick type of buttercream instead of the gourmet one that requires melted chocolate and 3 sticks of butter I used the latter and my friend my mother SHE S IN TOWN and I agreed that the frosting was overwhelming and distracted you from the cake too much THE BAD I can t think of anything bad about the cake My mom couldn t either That doesn t mean it was perfect though it was just really good THE UGLY aka ratings ratings in bold because they were not present in the original post Memoria 9 10 C1 6 5 C2 5 C3 0 Cake Mix C4 8 C5 7 5 Lydia 9 10 C1 5 C2 5 C3 0 Cake Mix C4 9 5 C5 7 5 Memoria s Mom new rater 8 10Lydia s Husband 10 10 C1 8 5 C2 9 C3 4 Cake Mix C4 9 C5 7 My Neighbor 9 5 10 C1 8 5 C2 9 C3 N A Cake Mix C4 9 C5 7 5 He said the cake was moist and fluffy He loved it Like I said we will be looking at other recipes to see if there is something better out there but so far this is my favorite and is the winner for now Yellow Butter Cake 6 oz 3 4 cup or 1 1 2 sticks unsalted butter 14 oz 1 3 4 cup superfine or regular granulated sugar I used regular 3 large whole eggs room temperature 1 egg yolk room temperature 6 oz AP flour 3 oz cake flour 1 tsp salt I used kosher 1 1 2 tsp baking powder 1 cup half n half 1 Tbsp vanilla extract Warren Brown also used 2 Tbsp of brandy Preheat oven to 350 degrees F 335 degrees if using a convection oven Prepare your 8 or 9 cake pans I used Baker s Joy Cream the butter and sugar for about 3 4 minutes Add in the eggs one at time making sure the batter is well blended before adding another egg I love how yellow this batter is after adding the eggs In a separate bowl whisk or sieve the flours salt and baking powder In a 2 cup 16oz liquid measuring cup mix the half n half and extract Pour in a 1 3rd of the dry and a 1 3rd of the wet ingredients and continue to alternate ending with the flour mixture The batter should be thick and tasty No longer yellow but still very delicious Pour batter into cake pans and bounce them on the counter to remove air bubbles and to make the batter even Bake the batter for 30 35 minutes or based on your own oven which I m sure functions better than my oven For the gourmet chocolate buttercream I used go here For the simple chocolate buttercream I recommend for this cake look below Cheaper Simpler Yet Still Tasty Chocolate Buttercream 1 cup 2 sticks unsalted butter room temperature 3 4 cups powdered sugar to taste 3 4 1 cup cocoa powder to taste 1 1 2 tsp vanilla extract 4 5 Tbsp milk to desired consistencyBlend the butter on high for about 1 2 minutes On LOW add the powdered sugar one cup at a time Add the cocoa powder Once mixed well add the vanilla extract and milk until desired consistency Happy 4th of July to all who observe this holiday UPDATE One of the readers of this blog asked about my reasons behind my changes to the recipe I actually addressed them on previous posts about the yellow cake but for sake of simplicity I answered her questions in the comments section but I thought it d be helpful to post my reasons here 1 1 yolk 3 eggs instead of 4 whole eggs To make the batter cake more yellow and less eggy tasting It didn t make the batter look more yellow but before adding the flour and half n half it looked yellow look at the next to last photo above Also we had another cake that called for 4 eggs and it tasted eggy 2 Cake flour instead of Potato Starch I didn t have potato starch and felt it unnecessary to purchase it for a cake I also wanted a recipe where most ingredients are accessible and usually found in most homes Even though not everyone has cake flour I believe it is more present in homes than potato starch Since Warren Brown of Cake Love said that the protein amount for the cake flour was different from that of potato starch I adjusted the ratio of AP vs cake flour The cake flour makes the cake lighter and the all purpose makes it a bit more dense ,url:mangiodasola 2010 07 search for perfect yellow cake part 6 html}',\n",

       "  u'{title:Autogenic training Wikipedia the free encyclopedia ,body:Autogenic training is a relaxation technique developed by the German psychiatrist Johannes Heinrich Schultz and first published in 1932 The technique involves the daily practice of sessions that last around 15 minutes usually in the morning at lunch time and in the evening During each session the practitioner will repeat a set of visualisations that induce a state of relaxation Each session can be practiced in a position chosen amongst a set of recommended postures for example lying down sitting meditation sitting like a rag doll The technique can be used to alleviate many stress induced psychosomatic disorders citation needed Schultz emphasized parallels to techniques in yoga and meditation It is a method for influencing one s autonomic nervous system Abbe Faria and Emile Coue are the forerunners of Schultz There are many parallels to progressive relaxation In 1963 Luthe discovered the significance of autogenic discharges paroxistic phenomena of motor sensorial visual and emotional nature related to the traumatic history of the patient and developed the method of Autogenic Abreaction His disciple Luis de Rivera a McGill trained psychiatrist introduced psychodynamic concepts 1 into Luthe s approach developing Autogenic Analysis 2 as a new method for uncovering the unconscious Herbert Benson MD a Harvard professor also did significant research in the area He called it the Relaxation Response and wrote an influential book with that same title edit Example of an autogenic training session Sit in the meditative posture and scan the body my right arm is heavy my arms and legs are heavy and warm repeat 3 or more times my heartbeat is calm and regular repeat 3 times my solar plexus is warm repeat 3 times my forehead is cool my neck and shoulders are heavy repeat 3 times I am at peace repeat 3 times Finish part one by Cancelling Start part two by repeating from step 2 to Cancelling Start part three by repeating from step 2 to Cancelling When you end your practice it is a good idea to Cancel to avoid your thoughts from inadvertently materializing To Cancel say arms firm and move your arms vigorously say breathe deeply and breathe deeply and say open eyes and at open your eyes 3 Many practitioners will choose not to cancel between the three iterations in order to maintain deeper relaxation Quite often one will ease themselves into the trance by counting to ten and exit by counting backwards from ten This is another practice taken from progressive relaxation edit Effects of autogenic training Autogenic Training restores the balance between the activity of the sympathetic flight or fight and the parasympathetic rest and digest branches of the autonomic nervous system citation needed This has important health benefits as the parasympathetic activity promotes digestion and bowel movements lowers the blood pressure slows the heart rate and promotes the functions of the immune system citation needed edit Contraindications Autogenic Training is contraindicated for people with heart conditions or psychotic disorders 4 edit Clinical evidence Autogenic training has been subject to clinical evaluation from its early days in Germany and from the early 1980s worldwide In 2002 a meta analysis of 60 studies was published in Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback 5 finding significant positive effects of treatment when compared to normals over a number of diagnoses finding these effects to be similar to best recommended rival therapies and finding positive additional effects by patients such as their perceived quality of life In Japan four researchers from the Tokyo Psychology and Counseling Service Center have formulated a measure for reporting clinical effectiveness of autogenic training 6 Autogenic training was popularized in North America particularly among practitioners by Wolfgang Luthe who co authored with Schultz a multi volume tome on Autogenic Training Luthe was a firm believer that Autogenic training was a powerful approach that should only be offered to patients by qualified professionals Like many techniques progressive relaxation yoga qigong 7 varieties of meditation which have been developed into advanced sophisticated processes of intervention and learning Autogenic training as Luthe and Schultz wrote in their master tome took well over a year to learn to teach and over a year to learn But some biofeedback practitioners took the most basic elements of autogenic imagery and developed condensed simplified versions that were used in combination with biofeedback This was done at the Menninger foundation by Elmer Green Steve Fahrio Patricia Norris Joe Sargent Dale Walters and others where they took the hand warming imagery of Autogenic training and used it as an aid to develop thermal biofeedback edit References Rivera JLGde Autogenic psychotherapy and psychoanalysis

       "  u'{title:USD no longer the world currency Vancouver Canada usd: no longer the world currency? | straight.com usd: no longer the world currency?,body:It s just straws in the wind so far India s Ministry of Culture announces that foreign tourists can no longer pay in dollars when visiting the Taj Mahal and other heritage sites they have to pay in good hard rupees Iran and Venezuela call for a joint OPEC statement on the weak U S dollar and Saudi Arabian Foreign Affairs Minister Saud al Faisal warns that any public reference to the U S dollar s problems could cause the troubled currency to collapse Rap star Jay Z s latest video shows our hero flashing a wad of euros not dollars Only straws in the wind but all in the past couple of weeks For the majority of Americans who do not travel abroad the only visible effect so far of the dollar s steep fall has been higher fuel prices at the pump The Chinese imports that fill the big box stores still cost the same because the Chinese yuan is still pegged to the American dollar But that may be about to change along with many other things At the beginning of 2003 one euro bought one U S dollar Eighteen months ago it bought 1 20 Now it is pushing 1 50 and there is no reason to think that it will stop there Three of the world s biggest oil exporters Iran Venezuela and Russia are demanding payment in euros rather than U S dollars Last week a Chinese central bank vice director Xu Jian gave voice to the suspicion of many others saying that the U S dollar was losing its status as the world currency If that happens then America loses a great deal Other countries have to maintain large reserves of foreign currencies most of which they keep in U S dollars to cover their foreign debts but the United States can pay its huge foreign debts in its own money If necessary it can just print more dollars Having their own money as the world s reserve currency confers advantages that Americans would miss if they lost them The main reason for the collapse of the U S dollar is President George W Bush s attempt to fight expensive foreign wars while cutting taxes at home This involved deficit financing on a very large scale and inevitably the value of the dollar began to fall slowly at first but with increasing speed as it became clear that the White House did not care Ronald Reagan proved that deficits don t matter as Vice President Dick Cheney told then treasury secretary Paul O Neill But they do matter to foreigners As the U S dollar fell in value the price of oil which is usually calculated in dollars rose to compensate for it but there was no comparable adjustment for foreign central banks that had huge amounts of U S dollars in their reserves China which was sitting on about a trillion U S dollars simply lost several hundred billion as the currency s value fell So various central banks started wondering if they should diversify their reserves and some acted on it The downward pressure on the dollar will continue because the United States is currently borrowing six percent of its gross domestic product from foreigners each year to cover its trade deficit Foreign banks were happy to go on lending so long as they had faith in the integrity of U S financial institutions but that has been hit hard by the subprime mortgage crisis Besides other markets notably China and India now offer a better return and Congress s resistance to foreign takeover bids combined with tighter visa restrictions makes the U S a less welcoming place for foreign investors Above all there are now alternatives to the U S dollar The last time it faced a comparable crisis was in 1971 when a different Republican president was trying to run another unpopular war without raising taxes Richard Nixon devalued the U S dollar and demolished the Bretton Woods system that had fixed all other currencies in relation to the dollar inaugurating the current era of floating exchange rates There was no other candidate then for the role of global reserve currency so the dollar stayed at the centre of the system despite all the turbulence This time by contrast there is the euro the currency of an economic zone just as big as the United States with the Chinese currency as a possible long term rival But nothing is likely to happen very fast The last time the world went through a change like this it took more than 40 years to complete Before the First World War the British pound reigned supreme accounting for 64 percent of the world s currency reserves and 60 percent of all international trade Britain then impoverished itself in two world wars but the U S dollar did not fully replace the pound until the 1950s Today the U S dollar accounts for 70 percent of both international trade and currency reserves but it is probably starting down the same road Many countries are replacing part of their dollar reserves with a basket of other currencies and those who have pegged their currency to the dollar are starting to cut loose from it Kuwait has already done so and the United Arab Emirates is actively considering it If China unpegs things will move a lot faster but in any case the long farewell of the U S dollar has begun though it may take decades, signs are appearing that the heyday of the us dollar is over, with the euro and the chinese yuan vancouver, canada, news, arts, movies, music,

       "  u'{title:The opposite of evil Google named best place to work in America ,body:Google GOOG CEO Larry Page and co founder Sergey Brin often get props for their brains But Google being named the best place to work in America by Fortune on Thursday may also have something to do with their noses From the company s earliest days the co founders who are said by some of the company s first employees to share an acute sense of smell and sensitivity to toxins have had an intense focus on air quality as one way to create a work environment second to none The company says its air quality rivals a hospital rather than an office building and it has long scrutinized all building materials including literally a sniff test to make sure they are free of chemicals with any health impact Although Fortune s article which lauds famous Google perks like free food drinks and massages doesn t mention the air company insiders cite it as an indication of Google s intense focus on employee well being We re really thinking about long term health effects said Anthony Ravitz who heads the Green Team for Google s Real Estate Workplace Services How can we extend the life span of our employees by 30 years Not a bad perk Google capped a year when it hired about 7 000 people the most intense growth spurt in the search giant s 13 year history with one of the most recognized human relations honors in corporate America on Thursday moving up from fourth to first on Fortune s annual pecking order of the 100 Best Companies to Work For The last time it topped the list was in 2007 Last year business software company SAS based in North Carolina came in first Other Bay Area companies also made the list including Sunnyvale s NetApp at No 6 Mountain View s Intuit INTU No 19 San Francisco s Salesforce com No 27 San Jose s Adobe Systems ADBE No 41 Santa Clara s Intel INTC No 46 San Rafael s Autodesk No 52 South San Francisco s Genentech No 68 and San Jose s Cisco Systems CSCO at No 90 There s no doubt Google has substantial perks ranging from the new 40 000 square foot athletic fields and park that the company built for employees at its Mountain View headquarters last year to the fleet of electric Chevy Volts and Nissan Leafs that Googlers can check out for free to its efforts to create a healthy environment Less clear experts say is whether what Google describes as a focus on people rather than perks has a direct payoff on the bottom line There is evidence said Stanford management science professor Bob Sutton that treating employees well does pay off There are large industry studies that show on average the firms that treat their workers do better over the long haul Sutton said But that s not to say Google despite all the workplace benefits is nirvana It can be a pressurized place to work even with micro kitchens stocked with free food It s not about bringing these perks to work and you work a 40 hour week at Google said Charlene Li founder of Altimeter Group It s that you have all these perks that enable you to work much more than 40 hours a week Some observers say Google s success is more the result of its global market dominance in search advertising than the payoff for how it treats its employees Google s legendary perks are as much the result of success as the cause said veteran tech analyst Rob Enderle who has studied workplace psychology Enderle said Google s extraordinary work environment is a powerful weapon in the bruising battle for talent in Silicon Valley but he said perks also can become entitlements that trigger worker anger if economics ever force a company to take them away Google executives don t see it that way What people often focus on are the flashy shiny things like the massages and the food which are really really important to us as benefits said Laszlo Bock Google s senior vice president for people operations But they are not the real story about what makes our culture work The real story Bock and other Google executives and workers said in a series of interviews this week about the company s culture is that Google treats employees as the owners of the company that it has an ethic of corporate transparency that allows the rank and file to criticize question and expect honest answers from their superiors even the CEO at the company s weekly TGIF all hands meetings and that the company wants employees to feel that everyone can have an impact both internally and in the larger world All of that stuff is free Bock said Contact Mike Swift at 408 271 3648 Follow him at

       "  u'{title:Chicken Kolhapuri eCurry The Recipe Blog ,body:Bold and spicy is what defines this chicken curry a very aromatic dish that heavily pronounces the flavors from the south western part of India Kolhapur a recipe as vibrant and rich as the history of this ancient town Kolhapuri Chicken has always been a favorite give me more kind of dish in our home but I never did cook the real thing until one day I discovered that the well trusted Parampara brand chicken Kolhapuri spice mix is not in my pantry I was all set and prepared to cook with the store bought spice mix Well if I am set to do something I will do it Parampara or not I went about making my own Kala masala it was close but not perfect as I did not have a few ingredients that the traditional spice mix uses The Kolhapuri paste was not that difficult to do The two homemades combined made the most delicious Kolhapuri chicken curry If you are missing a few ingredients from the spice mix in your pantry do not fret Indian cooking is very liberal and provides a very wide horizon that helps one to personalize the dish The curry will still be sensational if not originally true However you will definitely need the peppers fresh cilantro tomato and the coconut to make it Kolhapuri Don t forget H2Ope for Haiti The raffle is open and live now and will run till the 28th of February Buy ticket for minimal price and you and win 50 Amazon gift card my donation or any other wonderful prizes listed there Ingredients will serve about 6 2 5 lbs chicken skin removed and cut into 1 2 Feel free to use any kind of chicken pieces 1 4 cup oil For marinating 2 tablespoons yogurt 1 tablespoon turmeric 2 tablespoon red chili powder more or less 2 3 tablespoons Spice Mix Goda Masala or Kala Masala Mix Recipe Below May use the store bought powder too salt For the main Sauce 3 large onions sliced into thin half moons 4 cloves of garlic sliced or minced 3 fresh ginger grated or thinly sliced 1 2 can coconut milk about 7 oz 200ml 3 4 cup oil 1 teaspoon sugar salt 1 2 bunch fresh cilantro tender stalks and leaves 2 tablespoons fresh or dried coconut 3 4 cup tomato paste 1 2 cup water Spice Mix Goda Masala or Kala Masala Mix Light fry in oil 1 tablespoon white poppy seeds 1 2 teaspoon nutmeg 1 teaspoon cumin jeera 3 tablespoons coriander dhania seeds 1 5 teaspoon mustard seeds 1 teaspoon fenugreek methi seeds 1 teaspoon peppercorn 6 dry red chilli pepper more or less as per your spice tolerance 4 cloves 4 small green cardamom 2 cinnamon stick A pinch of hing asafoetida Dry Roast 2 tablespoons dried coconut 1 teaspoon sesame seed Preparation Preparing the Spice Mix Goda or Kala Masala mix Heat very little oil in a pan and very lightly fry the ingredients mentioned in the Light Fry at low heat for a couple of minutes Switch off the heat when they get fragrant Do take care and watch like a hawk for they will burn very quick Dry roast the coconut and sesame seeds for a couple of minutes till the coconut is very light brown Blend in a spice grinder or coffee grinder all the ingredients of the light fry and dry roast in a powder Note This spice mix is not exactly the kala goda masala mix I did not have all the ingredients that the authentic mix asks for this was pretty close If you do not have all the ingredients just skip them The taste of the curry might vary a bit but it is still going to be good if not 100 traditional Marinating Chicken Marinate chicken with yogurt turmeric salt chili powder and spice mix for at least an hour I left mine overnight Cooking the curry Remove the chicken pieces from the marinade and brown them in the heated oil on both sides they should be light brown does not need to be evenly brown Save the marinade Remove the chicken pieces and save the leftover oil Making the Sauce Kolhapuri sauce Heat 3 4 cup oil and fry the onions ginger garlic sugar and salt till the onions are brown and starts to caramelize Switch off the heat and transfer half of the onion mix from the pan to a blender or food processor along with the fresh cilantro coconut tomato paste water and the left over marinade and blend till smooth In the remaining half of the fried onions in the pan add the chicken and toss them and cook them for about 10 minutes at medium to high heat If the spices stick at the bottom of the pan do not worry Just sprinkle some water and scrape it off Add half of the mix from the blender to the chicken and the leftover oil from frying the chicken if you have any in the pan and stir everything gently Cook simmer for about 10 15 minutes at medium to high heat When you see the sauce reducing pour out the rest of the blended ingredients in to the pan Gently stir everything together for them to combine Cover and cook at low to medium heat till the chicken pieces are tender Uncover and increase the heat Add the coconut milk Cook till the oil separates you will see the sauce sizzling and bubbling and the little wells of oil on the sides and the top layer for about 15 minutes There should a considerable amount of sauce gravy left it is going to be a thick sauce which readily coats a spoon The flavor of this dish matures with time Let it sit overnight if you can before you serve it Serve hot with Basmati rice or Indian Flat Breads Spicy robust and delicious This is the kind of recipe that will make the aroma waft and dance around your home and linger in air and the taste that makes you want more and go back and cook it again in a few days time if you enjoy Indian food and strong flavors this is for you Now for the

       "  u'{title:The 15 Healthiest Berries You Could Possibly Eat Including 7 Most Haven t Heard Of ,body:The 15 Healthiest Berries You Could Possibly Eat Including 7 Most Haven t Heard Ofby www SixWise comFresh berries hanging from a branch are some of summer s most anticipated gifts Now is the time of year when these naturally sweet tasty treats are available in plenty but you can enjoy them in frozen varieties year round So go ahead and indulge in all that berries have to offer a sweet juicy taste reminiscent of long summer days an easy addition to snacks and meals and best of all incredible health benefits for you and your family Here are fifteen of the healthiest and tastiest 1 Blueberry The blueberry is quite possibly the healthiest fruit there is it ranked number one in antioxidant capacity by researchers at the USDA Human Nutrition Center when compared to 40 other fresh fruits and vegetables When it comes to brain protection there s nothing quite like blueberries says Tufts neuroscientist James Joseph I call the blueberry the brain berry he says attributing the effect to their antioxidant and anti inflammatory properties And the American Institute for Cancer Research has this to say We now know that blueberries are one of the best sources of antioxidants substances that can slow the aging process and reduce cell damage that can lead to cancer Aside from protecting the brain and fighting cancer blueberries have been associated with lower cholesterol protection against heart disease macular degeneration glaucoma varicose veins hemorrhoids and peptic ulcers and healthier elimination Rich in vitamins C and E manganese and dietary fiber about 30 different species of blueberries grow throughout the United States and Canada 2 Cherry As if their sweet taste wasn t enough of a reason to eat them cherries are rich in queritrin a flavonoid that s a potent anti cancer agent anthocyanins and bioflavonoids compounds that fight the pain from arthritis gout and migraines ellagic acid another potent anti cancer agent and melatonin which may help you sleep They also contain the soluble fiber pectin vitamin C beta carotene and potassium If it seems like cherries are only around for a short time you re right their season is only three months long Cherries come in two basic varieties sweet and sour The Bing cherry is the most popular of the sweet cherries and is best for snacking while the smaller and brighter sour cherries are most often used for pies sauces or other baked goods For a treat try the incredibly sweet and selectively grown Rainier cherries 3 Strawberry Like other berries strawberries contain phytonutrients called phenols that make it a heart protective anti cancer and anti inflammatory fruit Strawberries also help protect the brain from oxidative stress and age related decline and fight macular degeneration of the eyes They re an excellent source of vitamins C and K manganese fiber and iodine and they contain potassium folate riboflavin vitamin B5 omega 3 fatty acids vitamin B6 magnesium and copper There are over 600 varieties of berries out there and they can be used in everything from salads to breakfast shakes to desserts Because strawberries don t ripen any further once they re picked be sure to choose shiny berries with a deep red color and use them within a few days 4 Bilberry Similar to the blueberry bilberries are often referred to as European blueberries They re rich in antioxidants and are widely known as a potent protector of the eyes and have been linked to improvements in night vision cataracts macular degeneration and vision overall Interestingly the eye protective benefits of bilberries were first noticed during World War II when British Royal Air Force RAF pilots discovered that they had better night vision on bombing raids when they ate bilberry preserves beforehand The bilberry also contains compounds that enhance blood flow to circulatory vessels which means it may be beneficial for circulatory problems including varicose veins hemorrhoids and more Bilberries taste just like blueberries but they re about three times smaller in size 5 Blackberry Blackberries contain antioxidants vitamins C and E and ellagic acid all of which may protect against cancer and fight chronic disease They re also rich in the soluble fiber pectin which may help lower cholesterol and potassium Wild blackberries are actually related to the rose and like a rose they grow on a thorny bush Because they re highly perishable like all berries blackberries should ideally be used the same day they re bought and washed just prior to eating You can also freeze them by placing them in a single layer on a cookie sheet and then once frozen transferring them to an airtight container They ll keep for about six months 6 Elderberry In 400 B C Hippocrates referred to the elder tree as his medicine chest and it s been used since ancient times to treat colds flus arthritis constipation and more Today the elderberry is still in popular demand when it comes to health especially in Austria Germany and England Elderberries contain plenty of antioxidants anti viral compounds anthocyanins that help enhance immune function and compounds that help lower LDL bad cholesterol The berries are small and round and range in color from dark purple to bluish black Elderberries should not be eaten raw as they re mildly poisonous and can cause nausea or vomiting if eaten unripe and they re quite sour The mild toxicity is destroyed by cooking though so the berries are typically used to make jams jellies and homemade wine They can also be used in place of blueberries in things like muffins cakes and pies 7 Goji Berries It s said that a handful of goji berries in the morning will make you happy for the rest of the day Traditionally they re regarded as a potent food for longevity strength and sexual virility and are grown in Tibet in protected valleys that contain million year old soil that s reportedly untouched by pollutants or pesticides As tradition goes the berries are never touched by human hands this would cause them to oxidize and turn black but instead are shaken onto mats and then dried or made into a liquid juice There s even a legend that says Li Qing Yuen who lived to the age of 252 years 1678 1930 ate Goji berries every day Modern day studies have also found some benefits to goji berries they ve been said to have potential in fighting cancer and protecting the liver Goji berries contain 18 amino acids 21 trace minerals linoleic acid more beta carotene than carrots vitamins B1 B2 B6 and E selenium and germanium Goji berries are deep red in color and about the same size as a raisin They taste like a cranberry combined with a cherry and are typically eaten dried or in juice form 8 Lingonberries These small red oval fruits they re about the size of a large pea are a popular treat in Finland and other Nordic countries where their tart flavor is enjoyed in sauces and jellies Lingonberries are rich in the flavonoid quercetin which is a plant antioxidant that may help to prevent cancer and heart disease Fresh lingonberries are not easy to find in the United States but if you do find them you can use them as you would a cranberry They re often eaten crushed and mixed with sugar or cooked into sauces jams jellies juice and wine If you haven t heard of the lingonberry maybe you ve heard of one of its numerous other names cowberry red whortle berry foxberry northern mountain cranberry dry ground cranberry rock cranberry partridge berry or whimberry Or maybe not 9 Cranberries One of the most popular uses of cranberries to treat urinary tract infections has been used for centuries by indigenous cultures Today researchers have found that cranberries contain proanthocyanidins PACs which inhibit bacteria including E coli from adhering to the urinary tract thereby protecting it from infection They re also rich in antioxidants that may play a role in preventing heart disease and cancer and may play a role in preventing peptic ulcers by inhibiting H pylori from adhering to the stomach Because cranberries are so tart they re not usually eaten raw but instead are baked into pies muffins and cakes used as a juice or cooked into the American holiday favorite cranberry sauce 10 Raspberry Raspberries are rich in phytonutrients for antioxidant antimicrobial and anticarcinogenic protection Chief among these is ellagic acid the potent cancer fighter Raspberries have also been found to help prevent macular degeneration and they contain manganese vitamin C riboflavin folate niacin magnesium potassium dietary fiber and copper Raspberries have a long history they can be traced all the way back to prehistoric times but began to be grown widely in the 19th century when many new varieties including the loganberry and boysenberry were developed Raspberries have a sweet tangy taste that makes them a popular treat for snacks desserts salads cereals sauces baking jams jellies and more 11 Dewberry Dewberries are closely related to raspberries and blackberries with the same sweet taste but are slightly smaller and typically purple in color It is likely that they present similar health benefits to raspberries and blackberries 12 Mulberry Traditionally mulberry fruit has been used medicinally to treat the kidneys fatigue anemia and weakness Although not widely studied it s thought that mulberries contain high levels of antioxidants and similar health benefits as other dark colored berries like blueberries blackberries and raspberries The mulberry has a sweet somewhat bland flavor and is commonly used in jelly wine and desserts In its dry form the mulberry can be used as a raisin substitute 13 Gooseberry These fruits grow wild throughout the United States but they re typically cultivated in more tropical locations like Hawaii and South Africa They can range in color from white to green to pink or purple and they re typically about 1 2 to 1 inch wide though some varieties can grow as big as plums Gooseberries have a sweet sour taste somewhere between a strawberry and a pineapple Though not too common in the United States these days they taste great in pies jams jellies and cooked sauces or eaten fresh if you can find them If you re looking for a sweeter berry choose a gooseberry with a pinkish hue The green berries are unripe and work best for sauces and pies Gooseberries have similar nutritional qualities as strawberries cranberries and other berries 14 Huckleberry Huckleberries look just like blueberries and are often confused with them and taste like them too but a bit more tart but contain seeds that give them a unique crunchy texture The seeds are edible so they can be used interchangeably with blueberries but since they re not grown commercially you ll have to find them in the wild Huckleberries have not been studied extensively but may have similar health benefits as blueberries 15 Chokeberry Purple berries like chokeberries may possess as much as 50 percent more antioxidants than more common berries according to the U S Department of Agriculture However the raw berries are extremely tart hence the name chokeberry so they re best when cooked and made into juice jam or wine Recommended Reading If You are Nuts About Health Try the

       "  u'{title:Banana Chocolate Chip Cupcakes with Peanut Butter Cream Cheese Icing the chocolate peanut butter gallery ,body:I recently received Crescent City Cooking by Susan Spicer as a gift My taste tester decided to try out her recipe for Chocolate Chip Cake with Peanut Butter Cream Cheese Icing but used the batter to make cupcakes instead of a full on cake He made them while visiting family in Chicago but was kind enough to bring one all the way back to NJ for little ol me He even mixed both the cake batter and icing by hand that s dedication This cake is super moist and full of chocolate chips and don t even get me started on the cream cheese icing wow It s so moist and the flavor is just perfect I even forgot the vanilla extract when making it myself and it was just so rich and not overly sugary or buttery like most icings are Two tips when making these My taste tester really did a fantastic job making these The only tip I gave him was to mix the chocolate chips into the batter before the flour is fully incorporated to keep them from sinking to the bottom of your cupcakes Or if you forget to do this before the flour is all mixed in coat the chocolate chips with a bit of flour before mixing them in and you will get the same effect For the icing I would recommend sifting the sugar though it didn t say to in the original recipe It is a colored icing and you will notice white chunks of powdered sugar if you don t sift Also it s pretty worthless to pipe the icing with fancy tips so I d recommend just slopping it on with a butter knife or small spoonula It doesn t hold it s shape so well I m including the recipe but I highly recommend picking up this book Though this is the only recipe we have yet to try from it the selection of recipes is so different than most of the books we have Really fantastic stuff and not pretentious like a lot of fancier cookbooks can be For example she developed this recipe for a newspaper article on the Easy Bake Oven How cute I didn t bake mine in an Easy Bake Oven but it s nice to know you can Recipe with minor modifications after the break Banana Chocolate Chip Cake with Peanut Butter Cream Cheese Icingfrom Crescent City Cooking by Susan Spicer buy this book pg 332Makes 8 10 servings or 18 cupcakes Ingredients2 1 2 cups cake flour3 4 tsp baking powder1 tsp baking soda1 tsp salt1 1 2 cups mashed ripe banana1 1 2 tsp pure vanilla extract3 4 cup buttermilk1 4 pound plus 4 Tbsp 1 1 2 sticks butter for greasing1 cup sugar3 eggs3 4 cup semisweet chocolate chipschocolate chips or sweetened dried banana chips for garnish Directions1 Preheat the oven to 375 F Butter and flour two 8 inch round cake pans or line cupcake tins with paper liners 2 Sift the cake flour baking powder baking soda and salt together in a large bowl Whisk together the banana vanilla and buttermilk in a medium bowl In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy add the eggs one at a time and beat until well mixed 3 Add the dry ingredients and banana mixture to the butter mixture in three alternating stages dry wet dry ending with the dry Fold in the chocolate chips 4 If making a cake Divide the batter between the pans and bake for about 25 minutes or until springy in the center Allow cakes to cool in pans for about 10 minutes Run a knife around the rim of the pan to loosen cake then invert to release cake Cool completely on wire racks Spread icing between the layers and on the top and sides of the cake Sprinkle with chocolate chips if desired 4 If making cupcakes Fill each cupcake liner almost all the way full leaving 1 4 inch at the top of each and bake for about 19 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean Allow cupcakes to cool in pans for about 10 minutes then invert to release Cool completely on wire racks Spread icing on each cupcake and garnish with chocolate chips or sweetened dried banana chips Cupcakes should be kept in the fridge but taste better at room temperature so take em out a few minutes before devouring Peanut Butter Cream Cheese IcingMakes about 2 1 2 cups enough for 1 two layer cake or 18 cupcakes Ingredients1 2 cup creamy peanut butter1 8 oz package cream cheese softened1 1 4 cup confectioner s sugar sifted1 2 tsp vanilla extract Directions1 Cream the peanut butter and cream cheese in a mixer with the paddle attachment scraping the sides once or twice until light and fluffy Beat in the sugar gradually When completely incorporated add the vanilla ,url:cpbgallery 2008 06 04 banana chocolate chip cupcakes with peanut butter cream cheese icing}',\n",

time to take a break Sit in front of the TV watch It s a Wonderful Life paint your nails and then when they dry get your Profiterole makin on Consider learning how to make this cream puff dough like a gateway recipe to all things awesome For instance once you get this down you can make Profiteroles see above eclairs and all sorts of other pastries You see when you open them up there ll be a gigantic gaping whole It s meant for you to fill it with all sorts of custards cremes or in this case ice cream Amazing And surprisingly not too too difficult You re gonna start with bread flour And I normally would never recommend weighing flour but in this case it s a must If you don t have a scale then sift the flour first AND then measure Accuracy is important in this recipe Then get your butter on I weighed this too Then you re gonna add some water to a pot your cut up butter salt and little sugar and you re going to bring it to a boil AND then take it off the heat and add the bread flour It ll start to look like this Keep stirring at this point It s almost like making a roux you know when you re making mac n cheese and stuff Then add it to a stand up mixer and turn it on low with the paddle attachment just to get some steam out Sorry for the blurry as heck picture but I just wanted you to see what it looks like at this stage Then one by one add the eggs This is the consistency the batter should be at You see that little channel Right after you swipe your spatula through the batter the channel should fill in slowly That s how you know you have the right consistency If it s too think then add an egg white And keep going until it s juuuust right Then add it to a piping bag Or in my case a freezer bag Whatever And pipe it You should really be using a 5 round tip but I only had a 4 star tip Mine came out juuust fine Then brush on a little egg wash and put them in a pre heated oven to 350F Now this is when it gets interesting Right when you put them in the oven raise the heat to 425F This increase in heat will actually help the cream puffs rise even more Thank you Alton Brown and Dad For the last 10 minutes bring the heat down to 350F You want the moisture to bake out of the cream puffs I swear it s not that hard just use a timer No biggie Then Total cuteness You see how there s a hole in the center Let them cool on a baking sheet If you want poke a small hole on the side to let out even more moisture When you open it like below the center should be dry Even if it s a little wet no biggie Then you can do awesome things like filling them up with ice cream and pouring sexy chocolate sauce all over them Hot chocolate sauce cold ice cream crunchy yet soft pastry Amazing Oooooo One more idea Bake these one night take em to a party and let people assemble their own Profiteroles Fast way to make friends Guaranteed Recipe slightly adapted from The Fundamental Techniques of Classic Pastry Arts by FCI Cream Puff Dough a k a Pate a Choux 8 1 2 ounces 250 grams unsalted butter cut into small pieces 1 pint of water 1 4 teaspoon of sugar 1 4 teaspoon of salt 12 ounces bread flour sifted 10 to 12 large eggs at room temperature Egg wash one egg with a splash of water or milk Profiteroles Chocolate sauce chocolate and a splash of heavy cream Vanilla Ice Cream Prepare your mise en place a k a get your stuff together Preheat the oven to 350F Line the baking sheets with parchment or silicon baking sheets Set aside Combine the butter sugar and salt with 1 pint of water in a stainless steel saucepan over high heat and bring to just a boil Do not allow the water to boil for any length of time or it will begin to evaporate and the proprotion of liquid to dry ingredients will change compromising the final dough Once boiling immediately remove the pan from the heat and using a wooden spoon quickly beat in the flour Return the saucepan to medium heat and continue beating in the flour for 30 seconds The mixture should begin to thicken dry out and form a mass A think film should form on the bottom of the pan and the mixture should begin to pull away from the sides of the pan Take care that you do not overcook the mixture as the fat might separate out and the final product will have an unappetizing reddish tint Using a rubber spatula scrape the mixture into the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with the paddle Begin beating the paste at medium low speed to release some steam and to allow it to cool somewhat Working with one at a time crack each egg into a small bowl and then add it to the paste beating continuously until the paste is smooth and shiny You will know you have added enough egg when 1 a ribbon of dough forms and does not break when the paddle is lifted out of the bowl 2 a spoon run through the paste leaves a channel that fills in slowly and 3 a dollop of paste lifted on a spatula curls over on itself and forms a hook Then transfer the paste to a pastry bag and pipe it in alternating rows Using a pastry brush lightly coat each piece with egg wash Place baking sheet in oven and turn oven temperature to 425F bake for 15 minutes At the 15 minute mark turn oven temperature down to 350F and bake for another 10 minutes until nice and golden brown If they re starting to get too dark then remove Transfer to a cooling rack Take a small paring knife and pierce a small hold on the sides this will let out any moisture Then after 15 minutes they re ready to eat While the cream puffs are cooling add chocolate and heavy cream to a bowl and place over a saucepan with simmering water creating a double boiler Melt chocolate down until it reaches a smooth thick consistency Cut the cream puffs open place scoops of vanilla ice cream and top with sexy chocolate sauce Yum whoa!

Hearing one voice among many On the spot sports analysis Helping focus Creating superhumans Mixing digital technology with the human body Early stage development Hearing a voice inside the head Wearable tech Creating visual effects in real time Illusion of depth Eidos superhuman mask STORY HIGHLIGHTS Students at the Royal College of Art have created masks that can give enhanced sight and hearing First mask uses a microphone to isolate a specific sound in a noisy environment The other worn over the eyes can apply visual effects seen by the wearer in real time CNN Fans of Iron Man take notice A group of students at the Royal College of Art in London have created two masks that can give you superhuman sight and hearing The first prototype covers the wearer s ears mouth and nose and uses a directional microphone to give him the ability to hear an isolated sound in a noisy environment For example you could target a person in a crowd and clearly hear his words without the surrounding noise The other prototype is worn over one s eyes A camera captures video and sends it to a computer which can apply a set of effects to it in real time and send it back to the wearer One can for example use it to see movement patterns similar to the effects of long exposure photography Watch Wearable tech tracks your life We are used to controlling the world around us to find the settings that suit us best What if we had the same control over our senses Project Eidos team The team behind project Eidos Tim Bouckley Millie Clive Smith Mi Eun Kim and Yuta Sugawara see many possible applications of this technology For example one could use the visual mask it to analyze movement and technique in sports In another example concert goers could use the hearing mask to focus on a certain performer at a concert We are used to controlling the world around us to find the settings that suit us best But while technology advances to aid this our physical bodies remain the same What if we had the same control over our senses If we could adjust them in real time what experiences would this make possible they ask Read more Digital tattoos mind reading headphones Though the Eidos prototypes are relatively simple the ideas behind the project are interesting With wearable tech being the talk of the town as of late one has to wonder if Google Glass for example could be paired with visual or auditory augmentation technology to improve your senses What superhuman abilities would you like to gain from wearable tech Share your ideas in the comments 2013 MASHABLE com All

       "  u'{title:Consensus in DC It s RG3 ,body:There are a lot of clich\\\\u00e9s thrown around when the topic of pressure in sports is brought up Robert Griffin III doesn t buy into any of them They say pressure busts pipes I don t feel like I ve ever been that kind of guy my whole life in general especially in sports When the pressure s on I seem to play extremely well Griffin said And it s not just cause I m the greatest thing since sliced bread Griffin points out while holding back wry laughter Griffin continued it comes down to the guys around you You gotta have guys around you that believe in you and believe in themselves And it s your job as a quarterback to help them facilitate that belief so I think it goes full circle I ve been able to help my teammates play well in pressure situations During Griffin s record setting redshirt junior season at Baylor he excelled in numerous pressure packed situations drawing praise from fans and professionals alike One of those professionals was quarterback consultant guru Terry Shea A coaching disciple of the legendary Bill Walsh Shea has been working with quarterbacks on the collegiate and professional levels since 1968 His career highlights include leading San Jose State to a bowl victory in 1990 being named Big East Coach of the Year while at Rutgers in 1998 and prepping five first round quarterbacks for the NFL draft since 2007 Shea is currently training Griffin in Phoenix a new relationship that was facilitated by Griffin s agency Creative Artists Agency CAA CAA represents NFL players such as Drew Brees Mario Williams and Adrian Peterson Shea like other football insiders has no problem heaping praise on the young signal caller He s very impressive very bright and he picks up concepts very easily He s able to translate the concepts back to you with ease Verbally he has a great tempo specifically his speech pattern All of these things add up because when you ask a guy to quickly step into a huddle and make a call or communicate he s got a real upside to that part of his game said Shea While many fans lack an appreciation for Griffin s football IQ his on field aptitude is evident The other thing that I see that you probably don t see closely enough on TV or from a fan s perspective is his accuracy in terms of ball placement at the 18 22 yard pass route Not many QBs can accurately place a ball at that depth 18 22 yards There are a lot of accurate quarterbacks with the short game But he really has a special talent and he keeps the receivers on the run and that s the epitome of accuracy noted Shea Shea continues to work with Griffin as they approach his pro day on March 21st Griffin chose not to throw at the NFL combine in Indianapolis in late February instead choosing to focus on the forty yard dash and other drills If his pro day in Waco is anything like his combine performance fans and executives alike should be prepared for fireworks Griffin ran the second fastest forty yard dash time by a quarterback in the history of the combine clocking an incendiary 4 41 That kind of acceleration is usually reserved for I 95 on ramps The only quarterback to ever post a faster time was Reggie McNeal in 2006 with a 4 40 forty yard dash McNeal would later be drafted as a wide receiver by the Bengals McNeal has never taken a snap as a quarterback during his professional career in both the NFL and CFL The only time Griffin s speed is reined in is on the virtual gridiron Griffin will be the cover boy for EA Sports NCAA 2013 for PS3 and XBox Prior to winning the Heisman Trophy Griffin remembers that Baylor s 10 in the game was a bit slower than the real life counterpart I think my speed the first year was 89 And then the second year it was maybe 90 or 91 Then after I tore my ACL they shot my speed all the way down to 84 said Griffin Griffin s eye popping speed has been with him his entire life After graduating high school a semester early he enrolled at Baylor as a 17 year old During his first semester on campus he broke the NCAA Midwest Regional 400 meter hurdles record and advanced to the semifinals of the U S Olympic Trials Without track I wouldn t be the football player I am today The fact that I knew I could line up in the 400 the 200 the 100 the hurdles and I knew I could beat anybody who lined up against me That gave me the kind of confidence to go out and be the quarterback that I am With that belief that no matter what obstacle is put in front of myself and my teammates that we can go out and conquer it That s the beauty of being the quarterback you have the ball in your hands every play said Griffin Athletically Griffin enters this year s draft as the most gifted quarterback on draft boards since Michael Vick in 2001 Coach Shea believes the combination of Griffin s skills and the way teams are utilizing young quarterbacks may lead to early playing time Historically quarterbacks were really groomed for up to three years and then given their opportunity And that was pretty much the routine but I think that tradition that routine has been broken considerably by the onslaught of young college quarterbacks that have had great success their first or second year in the NFL And I speak from experience in this regard because I look at the Matthew Staffords that I ve coached and Josh Freeman and Sam Bradford and even Blaine Gabbert started his rookie season And with Cam Newton s success it starts to multiply itself There were a number of rookies this past year that started and I think that the teams are starting to see that these quarterbacks coming out of college are athletic enough number one and number two they re bright enough to absorb the playbook that they are ready to play Maybe not at a high level like Aaron Rodgers but Aaron was the traditional wait for a couple years to get your shot kind of player All the young quarterbacks in the league seem to be having relatively good success and I think that s opening up the eyes of teams Shea said One of those teams is the Washington Redskins Griffin appropriately pointed out that he may end up with another team come draft day noting that wherever he ends up he ll be excited to play For those who follow the league closely Washington s blockbuster trade with the St Louis Rams exchanging three first round draft picks for the second overall pick all but assures that RG3 will be suiting up for the Redskins this fall Griffin will join the likes of Ricky Williams Jeff George and Eli Manning all players who were secured through major draft trades But even the king s bounty that Mike Ditka and the Saints surrendered for Williams back in 1999 pales in comparison to what Dan Synder and the Redskins have agreed to While there have been some great success stories in the last few seasons regarding young quarterbacks the franchise altering potential of a bust weighs heavily on front offices and fan bases alike Despite that potential cloud hanging over April s draft coaches executives analysts and fans all seem to love Griffin s game When asked if there was a specific play that led Shea to believe that Griffin could be successful at the pro level he turned to what many analysts believe was the play that won Robert Griffin III his Heisman trophy The one play that had me jump right out my quarterback chair was when he threw a deep ball into the opposite corner of the end zone away from the defenders so only his player could get it said Shea referencing Baylor s final offensive play against fifth ranked Oklahoma in late November 2011 Shea continued he wasn t throwing it to the receiver he was throwing it to a spot anticipating the ability of his receiver to get to the ball I thought that was very very advanced And I said to myself this young guy plays the position with a lot of maturity Griffin s recollection of that play also speaks to his maturity The throw against Oklahoma to win the game you know that one brought me to tears it was such an amazing feeling because I knew how much that game meant not only to my head coach and the players on the team but to everybody in the community said Griffin Griffin saw the big picture It was Baylor s first victory over Oklahoma in twenty attempts and the school s first top five victory since 1985 Maturity on a football field often comes down to putting your mistakes behind you and carrying out the coach s game plan two things Griffin dealt with in the 2011 opener against fourteenth ranked TCU Griffin s first comment about the TCU game a performance in which he threw for 359 yards and five touchdowns was I was the reason we were behind in the first place I fumbled I was running the ball and I fumbled with three minutes left in the game and TCU goes down and scores a touchdown to go up by one A perfectionist at heart Griffin would have to put that play behind him and lead Baylor on a game winning drive We go back on the field and it s the last drive of the game a minute left in the game and we have to go score And we get two incompletions in a row and now it s third and ten and coach calls a double pass to the quarterback said Griffin This was a familiar situation for a program that hadn t finished in the top 25 since 1986 close but no cigar Fortunately for Baylor Nation as Griffin puts it they had a mature leader on the field A lot of times when coaches call trick plays they second guess it and by them second guessing it that makes you second guess it But as soon as I threw the incompletion on second down coach was already signaling for the double pass and I think the conviction he sent the play in with gave me the confidence to go out and run it As a player when you make a mistake you want the opportunity to make up for that mistake and I had my opportunity I knew it was going to be covered I knew they were going to know he was going to throw the ball right back to me but I also knew that no matter what happens I had to catch the pass recalled Griffin Griffin continued I threw it to Kendall Wright went right up the middle I had three guys draped on me Kendall still threw it in there and I got annihilated I mean I got hit pretty hard crossing the field and I held onto the ball And that s all that matters at the end of the day The pressure was on I had just made a mistake and I had to step up big in a situation I m not used to I m not used to catching passes over the middle and getting hit by three guys Kendall had the confidence to throw it I knew I had to catch it and I responded well in that situation said Griffin Seven plays later Aaron Jones split the uprights with a 37 yard field goal to give Baylor a 50 48 victory Griffin s success comes from a blend of dedication and joy How else could you explain a workout warrior like Griffin who also likes to don Superman socks It s all about balance for Griffin The socks thing is just something that started in high school I was just comfortable with who I was comfortable in my own skin so I went out and bought socks and just wore those People would laugh and laugh but whenever I got on the basketball court or the field or running track they always respected me because I wasn t just about the socks That discipline that hard work and dedication made me a better athlete because I was gonna go out and perfect my craft So yeah I might wear the funny socks and smile a lot and have a good time but when it comes to the game getting to business and making sure you do what you re supposed to do to be successful you better believe I m the first person in the door and I m the last one out And it s not just a clich\\\\u00e9 I literally do that I make sure I m the first guy there and I make sure I m the last guy out explained Griffin RG3 s dedication to excellence is illustrated by his response to a serious setback During the third game of his sophomore season Griffin tore his ACL playing against Northwestern State Griffin recounted that time in his life Your past can lead you to who you are in your future that injury shaped me not only as a person but as a player I didn t love football before my knee injury but after my knee injury I had to love football because you don t come back from an ACL tear if you don t love the game I wanted to come back and be a better player not just the same player So it really shaped me I watched my teammates struggle and I could see the pain in their eyes just like they could see the pain in my eyes when I tore my ACL So I wanted to come back for them to help my family and my future family and help Baylor Nation get the notoriety it deserves From those days rehabbing his knee to his run on the awards circuit this past season Griffin just keeps pushing forward looking to get better And as he gets better he has one final message for his future fan base After meeting with Heisman greats like Marcus Allen and Barry Sanders Griffin declared I don t wanna just be that Heisman guy that didn t work out in the pros I want to be that great player just like they were And they ll all tell you that if any kid comes up to them and says I wanna be just like you they d all tell them be better I take that advice I want to be better than all those guys Between Griffin s accuracy athleticism and leadership the only question regarding pressure may turn out to be how long it takes to transform collegiate carbon into an NFL diamond ,url:myhofs News Desc aspx nd FTHSC p Rq 6 AI}',\n",

       "  u'{title:The Realisation that Will Dramatically Change Your World ,body:Glen 34 Comments March 17th 2009 Subscribe via RSS What would you say if I told you there was one simple truth you could learn that will literally transform the rest of your life What if I said you probably already know this on a logical sense you just haven t applied it to your life yet As many of you know I m spending a lot of time living consciously and in the moment and therefore I get to see the dysfunction behind a lot of problems in life Through this awareness I ve literally been able to live each day very happily and peacefully while still having the drive to go for my goals Photo Credit Before I tell you this simple but life changing realisation I want you to do a little exercise with me Don t worry it s nothing physical and it should only take about 20 seconds of your time and I guarantee you will enjoy it Think of a time when you felt really really happy a time when you couldn t stop laughing or smiling even if you wanted to Whether it was when you won something a friend did something stupid your child was born or something of that nature Picture vividly a great event in your life that was so full of joy and happiness that it was just an amazing experience If you ve actually done this you ll begin to notice that these great feelings from that moment actually spread across to the current moment and make you feel good right now I can picture in great detail a time when I broke into someone else s car only to realise it wasn t mine my key worked and it makes me feel great because I can still laugh at it The event isn t happening right now but as I ve said in the past it is scientifically proven that our nervous system does not know the difference between an event that is real or one that is vividly imagined Because our body can t tell the difference it is very easy to feel great right now due to an event that happened in a completely different moment even one that happened years ago I personally find that amazing and through this I came to understand this simple realisation My Realisation I did say this was simple but you also have to make sure you apply it to your life Simply knowing about it and moving on will not affect your life at all and definitely not in a dramatic way My realisation is this only negative thoughts can create negative feelings It is said that we have around 65 000 thoughts every day and many of these thoughts you will be completely unaware of I m certainly aware of a large majority these days but only because I ve spent a lot of time practicing being conscious of them Some of the recurring thoughts include I m going to be too tall It s going to take too long for me to gain a large amount of weight I m never going to make enough money to travel the world Some people just have everything and I have to work Please note that I honestly don t care about these things at least not right now I m truly grateful for the situation I have in life my family my friends the opportunities available to me on this planet However I often catch myself through conscious exercise thinking negative thoughts the most repetitive tend to be ones linked to my goals I wonder if this is why so many people fail to complete theirs Now when I notice I m feeling low or de motivated for whatever reason it s always after or during negative thought patterns There is probably lots of thoughts going through your head as you are reading this post hopefully the personal nature in my writing is helping you to stick with the words Real World Examples If someone close to you passed away it s only natural that you feel bad Right However if someone close to me passed away you might offer me sympathy but you won t really feel anything negative regarding the situation After all you probably have no idea who the person is or what they were like When someone close to us leaves the world and I have experienced this we think that we have lost something we wonder about whether they died peacefully and we worry about how their family is going to cope You obviously can t be happy when someone close to you passes away and it s only natural to be sad but I wanted to make it clear that it is only our thoughts that make us feel this way nothing else These thoughts may be conscious but they are more often than not unconscious we are not aware of them Some other examples of negative thoughts people may have include I m struggling with my finances and can t pay my bills this month My cat is seriously ill and needs surgery I m only 5 3 so I could never date a really attractive woman I come from a poor family so can never become rich Some of these are facts some are opinions The cat that is seriously ill will need surgery if you want to prolong its life and you may seriously be struggling with your finances This is the point at which your thinking should stop no exceptions Your cat may need surgery know this take action and let whatever happens happen There is no need to spend the whole time before during and after the procedure in a state of fear worry and anxiousness Just like there is no need to spend each morning worrying about the repossession man coming to your door if you are in a poor financial situation If you can take action take action If you can t leave the issue until you can and completely rid yourself of the negative thoughts If good things are coming there will be a pleasant surprise If bad things are and you know in advance you will suffer greatly before they even occur Many see the world as a threatening place and because they do the world turns out to be a threatening place Maxwell Maltz I think that is an excellent quote and describes the situation so accurately We worry stress and fear situations long before they even occur and when they do they tend to not be as bad as we envisioned Applying this to Your Life Know this there is no way to have negative feelings unless you are thinking negative thoughts You can have physical pain but I m talking of feelings like worry fear anger or guilt that build up inside you And unless you really enjoy these negative thoughts you can change them at any time to something positive or even cut them out altogether through the likes of meditation There are two things I recommend you try to really help this message sink in and start to radically improve your life Observe your thoughts at random points throughout a day try to notice what thoughts are in your head As Tolle would say try and catch them like a cat waiting for a mouse to come out of a hole Use your feelings as a guide if you are feeling down for whatever reason then try to work out which thoughts have created this feeling or simply recognise that thoughts have created this feeling Even boredom is only boredom because we think the situation isn t entertaining and our mind wants something else to cling onto Practice these and let me know how this works for you Honestly since I started applying this about a week ago I ve became immensely happier in my day to day life simply through realising the exact thing that stops me from feeling peaceful or happy If you enjoyed this post I would appreciate if you share it on Twitter Facebook or Delicious the realisation that will dramatically change your world. pluginid.com is a motivational

       "  u'{title:Omnomicon makes halloween christmas recipe chocolate cherry mice ,body:I present to you that eleventh hour absolutely perfect finishing touch to your Halloween spread Once you ve gone through caramel apples popcorn balls pumpkin bread cookies cupcakes whoopie pies and cider donuts it s hard to be all that original without making something that looks like something else Alas the very concept of making a dessert that is appealing only insofar as its resemblance to a mummy s finger or a cat s litterbox is kind of like saying you would feed those things to your guests if only they were edible just because it s Halloween On the other hand is the risk of creating something that just doesn t quite hit the mark It s bad enough that I have to explain my costume look I didn t think Anne Boleyn was all that arcane a reference to have to explain See They re little ghosts adds some serious insult to injury And from a culinary perspective it s a little gimmicky and a little lazy and definitely trashy Despite the general tackiness of food that looks like something else when done well I can admire such a masterpiece for its cleverness A couple years ago I came upon this idea somewhere and if it was yours please do tell Recognizable right It s like a trick AND a treat all wrapped up in one adorable little package The last time I made these little guys I was sorely disappointed by a mushy final consistency to the dipping chocolate so I took the time this year to learn how to properly temper chocolate at Cooking for Engineers dot com Theirs is a great article to consult for a broad discussion of methods and the science involved and entire books are no doubt available on the subject I will be detailing only as much as applies to this effort But first Preparations are at hand Ever shucked corn Oh good today you ll be shucking Hershey Kisses You DO want to do this in advance of getting going with the chocolate because it is way more of a pain in the ass to unwrap these as you go You also want to sift through your giant pile of almond slices to pull out the pieces that are complete and have a nice look size shape to them It seems obvious in retrospect but at the time it didn t seem as though so many of these slices would be so unsuitable Also once the chocolate is on it s go time and it s not going to stop until you re done Now drain the cherries then pat them dry in a towel I made a little hobo bindle with my kitchen towel and rolled them around in there to dab em dry Previously I was under the impression that tempering one s chocolate was too difficult to attempt unless you were a chocolatier figuring that even a chocolate that has seized still tastes pretty good and as such never bothered Turns out it s not actually all that hard though maybe I just had good luck today You will need a thermometer but no super high heat candy thermometer necessary a meat thermometer will do nicely The easiest way to mess up your chocolate is to get water in it which is why I d avoid a rainy or otherwise humid day to take this on So if you re good on timing and equipment let s goOOOo Step 1 Make a double boiler Take a metal bowl with a lip and place it on top of a pot with 1 water like so Step 2 Chop your chocolate I did not do this but it would have helped melt everything more easily One third is going in the pot and the rest is staying behind for later Step 3 Melt Put chocolate in bowl set burner to medium high Once the chocolate begins to melt reduce heat to medium Stir the whole time with a rubber spatula until the chocolate s temperature is near 115 oF 46 oC for semisweet chocolate chips if using milk chocolate or white chocolate 110 oF 43 oC Step 4 Remove from heatBut leave the bowl in the pot for the next part Step 5 Seed Take the remaining ounce of chocolate and stir into the molten stuff Stir continuously until temperature is between 88 oF and 90 oF for semisweet chocolate chips if using milk chocolate or white chocolate 86oF and 88 oF And that s tempering chocolate ta da Here s how beautifully smooooove it looks Keeping the bowl at an angle helps with the dipping process i e there s more to dip into and it holds its heat better Lay out on parchment paper or wax paper Dab on a Kiss And ears See how well tempered my mice are My Aleta you are positively punning tonight bahuffhuffhuff These little guys don t look like much all stacked together on a plate but I felt pretty clever sticking them on a cheese plate Get it Cuz they re mice Oh Martha Stewart you have some counterculture competition coming your way Cute enough to make up for illustrating what in true practice would actually be quite disgusting I m calling it a win When made lovingly personalities will emerge There s the ambitious one The so frugal it s downright stingy one And the one with a really undeniably cute butt Chocolate Cherry Mice Small batch makes 25 1 small jar Stem On Maraschino Cherries 10oz 25 count 1 3 bag Hershey Kisses 4oz 25 total 4oz chocolate avoid chips if possible semisweet dark or milk as desired 50 almond slivers you ll need to pick through a lot to get this many so I recommend starting with a large bag at least a cup Large batch makes 75 safer in terms of chocolate temper 1 LARGE 10 oz 50 count jar Stem On Maraschino Cherries1 small 16 oz 25 count jar Stem On Maraschino Cherries1 bag Hershey Kisses 4oz 75 total 12oz chocolate avoid chips if possible semisweet dark or milk as desired 150 almond slivers start with at least 3 cups Equipment Metal or heatproof bowl with lipMeat thermometerRubber spatula Word on the internet is no metal no wood A sunny low humidity day best tempers chocolate but rainy day mice will be just as yummy if not as shiny Drain cherries do not rinse Place a handful at a time in a kitchen towel craft into a bindle and shake around to absorb as much moisture as possible Leave in towel for now Unwrap all Hershey kisses and set on a platter for easy access Sort through almond slices until you have two nicely shaped slices for each mouse s pair of ears Line 1 3 cookie sheets or cutting boards with parchment paper or wax paper They need to be able to fit in your fridge Chop chocolate reserving about a third chopped pieces 1 25oz for batch of 25 4oz for batch of 75 If using chocolate chips no need to chop Make a double boiler by placing a bowl with a lip over a medium pot saucepan with about a half inch of water Set burner to medium high and once the chocolate begins to melt reduce to medium Stir continuously with rubber spatula As soon as you can see no more individual pieces check the temperature and continue to cook until it just enters the appropriate target Err on the side of removing too soon if the temperature is still rising rapidly as it nears your target Dark Semisweet 115 oF 46 oC Milk Chocolate 110 oF 43 oC White Chocolate 110 oF 43 oC Turn off stove remove bowl from pot and place on a towel to absorb extra moisture Add in remaining chocolate and stir constantly until temperature is at tempering range Dark Semisweet 88 oF 90 oF 31 oC 32 oC Milk Chocolate 86 oF 88 oF 30 oC 31 oC White Chocolate 80 oF 82 oF 27 oC 28 oC Holding stem dip each cherry in the liquid chocolate then set on parchment wax paper Set your mice about two inches apart to allow space for the Hershey Kiss and a little fiddling and so no tails are caught in his neighbor s warm chocolate Once all cherries are dipped and starting at the beginning again set a Hershey Kiss in front of each cherry to make a head It helps to rest it on the cherry at an angle as though the mouse is looking up Aesthetically an upturned nose is cuter Once all cherries are headed and starting at the beginning again stick one almond slice on either side of the head to make ears Try not to touch the wet chocolate but you can use the Hershey Kiss and the tail to help position these just so If the chocolate is not tacky enough wait a couple minutes and try again but be careful not let it get too cool And finally once your mice can hear you set platters in fridge for 1 4 hours to firm up To remove seize the mouse by its tail Squeak Serve on a cheese platter for maximum effect Really it s so adorably cute ,url:omnomicon chocolate cherry mice}',\n",

       "  u'{url:admagic blog 2013 06 04 15 sports promotions horribly wrong,title:15 Sports Promotions That Went Horribly Wrong ,body:It s a sports marketing professional s job to build interest in the organizations and events he or she is promoting But sometimes that interest isn t exactly a good thing Yes no matter what you ve heard there can be such a thing as bad publicity To make our case we submit to you these 15 Sports Promotions That Went Horribly Wrong Some are funny some tragic Some were bad luck and others will make you wonder how the people who came up with them ever survived in the real world Here goes 1 EliteXC The UFC was already established when Elite XC came along in 2006 hoping to make a splash with a network TV deal via CBS The promotion gave the sport of MMA Gina Carano Cristiane Cyborg Santos Marloes Coenen Sarah Kaufman Antonio Bigfoot Silva Jake Shields Robbie Lawler and KJ Noons to name a few But it also loosened its criteria substantially when it took a chance on an Internet fighter named Kimbo Slice Elite XC went to great lengths to protect Slice feeding him opponents to protect an unbeaten record against nobodies But bad is bad and it finally caught up with everyone when Slice fought journeyman heavyweight Seth Petruzelli and lost in an early knockout Petruzelli later admitted that promoters asked him to keep the fight standing to make their guy look better That lasted until he landed the first punch Then it was pretty much out of his hands Between betting on a loser and basically trying to fix the fight Elite XC had a PR nightmare on their hands But they wouldn t have to deal with it long The promotion folded after two more PPVs Image Source 2 McDonalds McDonalds saw the 1984 Olympic Games as an excellent time to promote free Big Macs fries and soft drinks When the US wins you win they proudly told customers Unfortunately for their bottom line they didn t recall the 1980 US led boycott of the Moscow Games and when it came time for the US to host four years later the Eastern bloc Communist countries returned the favor That meant the US won medals lots of them And customers won something with virtually every game piece What s worse when people would cash in their game pieces for free burgers they would get more game pieces with more free stuff While McD s bottom line recovered nicely you can bet some marketing folks had some explaining to do Image Source 3 XFL World Wrestling Entertainment WWE head Vince McMahon conceived the idea to venture into professional football in 2000 For one year he built hype surrounding the idea for the XFL an extreme version of the game One example the opening coin toss would instead be handled by placing two players equidistant apart with a football in the center At the blow of the whistle they would have to make a rush for the pigskin and whoever came out of the scrum triumphant won the option to kick or receive Other extreme ideas scantily clad cheerleaders and well that was about it Same Exact Game Only with annoying camera angles and less talent Hardly worth the one year of promotion and the millions of dollars McMahon poured into it XFL was out of business after the first season For those keeping score the Los Angeles Xtreme were the first and only champions For more info head over to the XFL tribute site Image Source 4 West Michigan Whitecaps In 2006 someone from the West Michigan Whitecaps minor league baseball organization thought it would be a great idea to have a cash drop at Fifth Third Ballpark the team s home stadium The Whitecaps had just scored a 3 0 victory over their opponents Children from ages five to 12 lined the outfield fence as a helicopter flew overhead and dropped about 1 000 in cash Two kids both age seven were trampled in the melee though thankfully not killed Club representative Katie Kroft s response to ESPN It s for fun and games This is why we have everybody sign a waiver Image Source 5 Evel Knievel Robert Craig Knievel aka Evel Knievel became a household name with his infamous jump of the fountains at Caesars Palace on December 31 1967 The total distance was 141 feet It was to be the longest of his career but when Knievel hit the ramp he felt his bike decelerate and came up short on the other side resulting in a spectacular crash He paid for the filming of the stunt himself and was able to fetch a large amount of money for it from ABC s Wide World of Sports However he also crushed his pelvis and femur and had a number of other fractures to his hip ankles and wrist The crash also left him with a concussion that placed him in a coma for 29 days according to Motorcycle Classics For the rest of Knievel s life he would be uninsurable Image Source 6 LeBron James On July 8 2010 LeBron James would make one of the most ill advised self important decisions that a pro athlete has ever made No it wasn t deciding to join Cleveland s rival team the Miami Heat though that had something to do with it It was instead The Decision to end his free agency in an hour long event televised on ESPN without first telling anyone else not coaches teammates fans nobody Now we re not going to say James is a bad dude He later lamented that he should have handled things differently and we respect that But at the time it was a pretty big D move and it s one that his image will never recover from in his home state of Ohio Image Source 7 Steve Dahl and Garry Meier of 97 9 WLUP No list of sports promotions that went horribly wrong would be complete without including the July 12 1979 contest between the Chicago White Sox and the Detroit Tigers The game took place at Comiskey Park and it would achieve infamy for doubling as Disco Demolition Night Steve Dahl and Garry Meier of 97 9 WLUP radio invited everyone to bring their disco records for an epic meltdown The White Sox organization expected about 20 000 people Anywhere from 50 000 to 90 000 showed up and they were all looking to say goodbye to the BeeGees forever Disco records sailed like flying saucers onto the field even after Dahl had collected a heap in a giant box that he exploded between games of a two night doubleheader Before the night was through the White Sox were forced to forfeit game two and riot police had to be called in Image Source 8 WWE Over the Edge Most of the entries on this list of sports promotions that went horribly wrong at least have the advantage of never resulting in an actual death Not so in the case of the 1999 WWE Over the Edge pay per view Owen Hart was playing a superhero like character known as The Blue Blazer Part of the gimmick involved him swooping down from the rafters from around 70 feet in the air Unfortunately an equipment malfunction early in the descent resulted in Hart plummeting to his death inside the ring The attempt at promoting Hart s character ended in tragedy in front of a live audience and millions watching at home Image Source 9 Jose and Ozzie Canseco Jose Canseco and Ozzie Canseco look a lot alike So much so that Jose who was attempting an ill fated post baseball boxing career tried to pull a switcheroo on fans at a Celebrity Boxing matchup in Hollywood Florida Promoter Damon Feldman didn t notice but his handlers did Ozzie never stepped into the ring and unfortunately for Feldman he d already paid the former Oakland A s slugger Jose 5 000 a disaster for Feldman s pocketbook and for the Canseco brothers reputations Not that they re that concerned about it Image Source 10 Umbro Umbro is a big name in the field of sports clothing but even the giants can make mistakes Big ones Like naming a shoe after the Zyklon gas used by the Nazis to kill Jewish people during World War II An Umbro spokesperson later lamented We regret that there are people who are offended by the name The naming of the shoe is purely coincidental and was not intended to communicate any connotations They later dropped the line altogether Image Source 11 Blue Collar Brawlin Blue Collar Brawlin in Fort Smith Arkansas was supposed to be a regional MMA event with 1 beer but little did patrons know Sacha Baron Cohen had arranged a graphic scene of erotic wrestling with another man inside the cage as the main event He was shooting footage for his upcoming mockumentary Bruno A drunken riot bolstered by an arena full of drunken anti homosexual southerners ensued Amazingly Cohen and his wrestling partner escaped alive but it wasn t from lack of trying Image Source 12 Los Angeles Dodgers Following the 1979 Chicago White Sox forfeit on Disco Demolition Night see no 7 there wasn t another in the Major Leagues until a 1995 matchup between the Los Angeles Dodgers and St Louis Cardinals Not coincidentally that was the same night of the promotion known as Ball Night at Dodger Stadium A number of fans received Dodgers baseballs for attending the game which found the Cards leading 2 1 in the bottom of the ninth That s when Raul Mondesi struck out and launched into a tirade against the umpire that would end with him and manager Tommy LaSorda getting ejected from the game Fans reacted by refunding their balls onto the field Some reports have placed the total at more than 200 Once the balls were cleaned up more were thrown onto the field and at that point the ump called it Image Source 13 Cleveland Indians Alcohol has been a recurring theme with sports promotions that went horribly wrong and 10 Cent Beer Night in 1974 was no exception The offending party was the Cleveland Indians organization The scene was Municipal Stadium More than 60 000 cups of brew sold at 10 cents a pop made for a drunken melee that involved rampant streaking fireworks and the riot police Before the end fans and players from Cleveland and their opponents the Texas Rangers engaged in the physicality resulting in a Major League disaster Image Source 14 Reebok The short story behind the Dan and Dave campaign is this Dan O Brien and Dave Johnson were tremendous track and field athletes and Reebok looking to claim market share from Nike decided to pit them against one another in a friendly competition that would be played out through print and broadcast media for eight months leading up to the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona America would watch the men grow up in a series of home movies from when they were kids The country would have two titans to represent and probably win the gold Except that didn t happen In fact Dan O Brien failed three times to clear his entry height of 15 feet nine inches in the pole vault and would not even make the Olympics Dave Johnson would win one medal a bronze but that was it Both men rebounded beautifully and O Brien would eventually win the gold in 1996 But the Dan and Dave campaign Dead in the water Mental Floss has a nice breakdown if you d like to know more Image Source 15 Hooters When Hooters offered PGA golfer John Daly all the food and drink he could possibly consume as part of an endorsement deal in 2008 they probably should have checked to see if he was an alcoholic before drawing up the contracts In October of that year Daly took them up on those perks especially the booze part and one Saturday night he got so hammered drunk that cops were forced to come out to Hooters and take him into custody According to a report from ESPN police described Daly as extremely intoxicated and uncooperative Not exactly the way you want your spokesperson to advertise your business He s still awesome though Image Source Those are our top picks for sports

crass and barbaric but more importantly it is the exact type of in your face honesty that is missing from the life of most overweight people This site is not here to make you feel bad or to make fun of you This site is here to open your eyes to how obvious your problem is and how easy it is to fix If you are overweight you can do one of two things 1 Be offended hit the back button now and go cry yourself in to a tub of ice cream2 Read this page laugh at the bluntness and choose to change your life TODAY If you take offense to anything you read on this site there has to be a reason why a reason deeper than the excuse you tell yourself as you curse my name If the shoe fits wear it change it and start wearing new shoes If the shoe doesn t fit then you should not take offense at all Think you can handle the unfortunate brutal and 100 reversable truth Read on if you dare You re fat because you eat too much Let s just start with that If you re fat you re eating too much damn food Period It s not your parent s fault for giving you the fat gene It may be their fault that they made you like food so much but for once in your fat life let s stop blaming other people OK But I can hear you whining already like you always do You don t really eat much right You might even go so far as to say But I only eat salad Yes I ve heard that before SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU FAT LIAR Guess what salad didn t come inside those Big Mac wrappers in your back seat All 25 of them You fucking lying piece of shit you eat a salad in front of everyone when you go out to lunch and act like you re eating healthy then you go home and down a quart of ice cream after your fried chicken If this relationship is going to work you need to be truthful to not only me but yourself Look in the mirror right now and say I am a big fatbody because I eat too much damn food There Now we can move on You re fat because you want to be Yes you want to be fat If I woke up tomorrow suddenly as fat as you what do you think my reaction would be Do you think I would say Aww wahh I m fat I sure wish I could lose weight and then go eat three Big Macs and a diet Coke You bet your fat ass I wouldn t I would be working like hell to get rid of the disgusting fat I guarantee you that if through some weird science experiment my brain was placed in your fat fucking body I would be fit and running a marathon within a year But you no you re doing nothing are you Your salad for lunch and diet Coke with your fried chicken is all for show They require no effort Yet you want credit for it don t you And you want people to think Well damn that fat fucker must be fat because of their unfortunate genes I saw them drink Diet Coke yet they re still fat That s too bad But nobody thinks that everyone knows why you ve got more rolls than a sushi restaurant The Thin People around you didn t get lucky This is actually something I find extremely offensive when fat people chide me for watching my diet Oh you don t have to worry about your weight they ll say to me if I turn down sweets or extra portions Guess what you fucking fatty I m not fat BECAUSE I worry about my weight I ran 20 miles this week I made a healthy lunch and brought it to work every day What did you do Oh you sat on your ass and stuffed your mouth full of food that s right And then you have the nerve to tell me that I m fit because I got lucky When my body fat percent goes up a couple percentage points I adjust my diet That way I always stay where I want to be It s like balancing your checkbook If you just write checks willynilly you re going to overdraw your account You re doing the same thing by paying no attention to how much weight you re packing on while eating whatever you want Don t fuck yourself up by your own doing then discount my own hard work It s insulting You re fat because you don t exercise Yes the human body was meant to move Sitting on your ass all day isn t helping matters Don t give me any crap about But I don t want to kill myself at the gym Oh I see Would you like to go hiking Biking Skiing Play sports Or would that kill you too If so you re going to die on the couch Living life like our bodies intended isn t making the rest of us fall down and croak You re fat because you want a shortcut Did you ever buy any workout equipment advertised on late night TV How about miracle diet pills Got a Thigh Master in your closet Or some stupid little gizmo that s supposed to help you do crunches and tone your abs You do You know why you have that Because you re a FUCKING idiot that s why Because you re afraid of hard work and actual self discipline you tried the easy way out and made someone else richer because of it None of that crap works but it s easy to sell Why Because stupid people buy that shit And who are they marketing to Fat asses And why are they fat asses Because they re stupid Case closed You fatties buy the stupidest stuff your heads must be shoved deep inside your fat asses Stop buying stupid shit It s not your thyroid Do you know how many fat people have a thyroid problem Less than 1 Unless you ve gone to the doctor and he told you that you have a thyroid problem then the problem is not your thyroid it s your hands shoveling food into your fat fucking mouth that s what the problem is If the problem is your thyroid then your doctor will treat it and it will no longer be an excuse anyway The way I see it if you really were concerned with your thyroid you would go get it checked out If you refuse all it does is further illustrate my point above that you are fat because you want to be If honestly are with your thyroid you would in the doctors office faster than your fat fucking friends can plow down an oreo cookie blizzard Instead you prefer to use your thyroid as an excuse so that you can keep eating garbage all day and stay nice a un comfortable in the fat lazy victim role you have been playing your entire life You are NOT Big Boned Are you fucking kidding me Is there some relationship between the bones inside your body and the fat rolls on the outside No there isn t The fact that I can t tell where your neck ends and your face begins is because of fat not big bones You don t have bones over your abdomen you have fat rolls Seriously can you even feel any of your bones Look at the x ray pictures on the right Does the fat person have big bones No they fucking don t They have fat I ve even heard some fatties say they have thick skin Are you really that stupid Skin isn t three inches thick Oh wait your argument is that your big frame naturally has large muscles on top of those big bones so you ll never be able to be as thin as those rail thin models right This is an interesting mental problem with fatties If I can t be that thin I ll just be REALLY fat instead Does that make any fucking sense at all Guess what no matter how much lean body mass you have you ll still look good without fat covering it Even if you really do have more bone and muscle it in no way causes you to carry more fat If this were true bodybuilding would be impossible because all those men and women many of them big boned as those people can build more muscle mass would be big fatasses You don t have curves I have curves No you fucking don t Fat rolls do not equal curves A woman with curves has nice lines that taper down to a slim waist hips that curve out nicely and shapely legs Just because you have a big wide ass doesn t mean you have curves especially if you look like the Michelin Man If your gut is hanging over your belt that s not a curve that s disgusting So now that we ve got that out of the way what do you do about it Or click this little button and buy my fat burning eBook for only 37 ,url:yourefatbecauseyourestupid}',\n",

       "  u'{title:The Mother of All Antioxidants glutathione: the mother of all antioxidants glutathione: the mother of all antioxidants,body:It s the most important molecule you need to stay healthy and prevent disease yet you ve probably never heard of it It s the secret to prevent aging cancer heart disease dementia and more and necessary to treat everything from autism to Alzheimer s disease There are more than 89 000 medical articles about it but your doctor doesn t know how address the epidemic deficiency of this critical life giving molecule What is it I m talking about the mother of all antioxidants the master detoxifier and maestro of the immune system GLUTATHIONE pronounced gloota thigh own The good news is that your body produces its own glutathione The bad news is that poor diet pollution toxins medications stress trauma aging infections and radiation all deplete your glutathione This leaves you susceptible to unrestrained cell disintegration from oxidative stress free radicals infections and cancer And your liver gets overloaded and damaged making it unable to do its job of detoxification In treating chronically ill patients with Functional Medicine for more than 10 years I have discovered that glutathione deficiency is found in nearly all very ill patients These include people with chronic fatigue syndrome heart disease cancer chronic infections autoimmune disease diabetes autism Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease arthritis asthma kidney problems liver disease and more At first I thought that this was just a coincidental finding but over the years I have come to realize that our ability to produce and maintain a high level of glutathione is critical to recovery from nearly all chronic illness and to preventing disease and maintaining optimal health and performance The authors of those 76 000 medical articles on glutathione I mentioned earlier have found the same thing So in today s blog I want to explain what glutathione is why it s important and give you 9 tips that will help you optimize your glutathione levels improve your detoxification system and protect help yourself from chronic illness What is Glutathione Glutathione is a very simple molecule that is produced naturally all the time in your body It is a combination of three simple building blocks of protein or amino acids cysteine glycine and glutamine The secret of its power is the sulfur SH chemical groups it contains Sulfur is a sticky smelly molecule It acts like fly paper and all the bad things in the body stick onto it including free radicals and toxins like mercury and other heavy metals Normally glutathione is recycled in the body except when the toxic load becomes too great And that explains why we are in such trouble In my practice I test the genes involved in glutathione metabolism These are the genes involved in producing enzymes that allow the body to create and recycle glutathione in the body These genes have many names such as GSTM1 GSTP1 and more These genes impaired in some people for a variety of important reasons We humans evolved in a time before the 80 000 toxic industrial chemicals found in our environment today were introduced into our world before electromagnetic radiation was everywhere and before we polluted our skies lakes rivers oceans and teeth with mercury and lead That is why most people survived with the basic version of the genetic detoxification software encoded in our DNA which is mediocre at ridding the body of toxins At the time humans evolved we just didn t need more Who knew we would be poisoning ourselves and eating a processed nutrient depleted diet thousands of years later Because most of us didn t require additional detoxification software almost of half of the population now has a limited capacity to get rid of toxins These people are missing GSTM1 function one of the most important genes needed in the process of creating and recycling glutathione in the body Nearly all my very sick patients are missing this function The one third of our population that suffers from chronic disease is missing this essential gene That includes me Twenty years ago I became mercury poisoned and suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome due to this very problem My GSTM1 function was inadequate and I didn t produce enough glutathione as a result Eventually my body broke down and I became extremely ill This is the same problem I see in so many of my patients They are missing this critical gene and they descend into disease as a result Let me explain how this happens The Importance of Glutathione in Protecting Against Chronic Illness Glutathione is critical for one simple reason It recycles antioxidants You see dealing with free radicals is like handing off a hot potato They get passed around from vitamin C to vitamin E to lipoic acid and then finally to glutathione which cools off the free radicals and recycles other antioxidants After this happens the body can reduce or regenerate another protective glutathione molecule and we are back in business However problems occur when we are overwhelmed with too much oxidative stress or too many toxins Then the glutathione becomes depleted and we can no longer protect ourselves against free radicals infections or cancer and we can t get rid of toxins This leads to further sickness and soon we are in the downward spiral of chronic illness But that s not all Glutathione is also critical in helping your immune system do its job of fighting infections and preventing cancer That s why studies show that it can help in the treatment of AIDS i Glutathione is also the most critical and integral part of your detoxification system All the toxins stick onto glutathione which then carries them into the bile and the stool and out of your body And lastly it also helps us reach peak mental and physical function Research has shown that raised glutathione levels decrease muscle damage reduce recovery time increase strength and endurance and shift metabolism from fat production to muscle development If you are sick or old or are just not in peak shape you likely have glutathione deficiency In fact the top British medical journal the Lancet found the highest glutathione levels in healthy young people lower levels in healthy elderly lower still in sick elderly and the lowest of all in the hospitalized elderly ii Keeping yourself healthy boosting your performance preventing disease and aging well depends on keeping your glutathione levels high I ll say it again Glutathione is so important because it is responsible for keeping so many of the keys to UltraWellness optimized It is critical for immune function and controlling inflammation It is the master detoxifier and the body s main antioxidant protecting our cells and making our energy metabolism run well And the good news is that you can do many things to increase this natural and critical molecule in your body You can eat glutathione boosting foods You can exercise And you can take glutathione boosting supplements Let s review more specifics about each 9 Tips to Optimize your Glutathione Levels These 9 tips will help you improve your glutathione levels improve your health optimize your performance and live a long healthy life Eat Foods that Support Glutathione Production 1 Consume sulfur rich foods The main ones in the diet are garlic onions and the cruciferous vegetables broccoli kale collards cabbage cauliflower watercress etc 2 Try bioactive whey protein This is great source of cysteine and the amino acid building blocks for glutathione synthesis As you know I am not a big fan of dairy But this is an exception with a few warnings The whey protein MUST be bioactive and made from non denatured proteins denaturing refers to the breakdown of the normal protein structure Choose non pasteurized and non industrially produced milk that contains no pesticides hormones or antibiotics Immunocal is a prescription bioactive non denatured whey protein that is even listed in the Physician s Desk Reference Exercise for Your Way to More Glutathione 3 Exercise boosts your glutathione levels and thereby helps boost your immune system improve detoxification and enhance your body s own antioxidant defenses Start slow and build up to 30 minutes a day of vigorous aerobic exercise like walking or jogging or play various sports Strength training for 20 minutes 3 times a week is also helpful Take Glutathione Supporting Supplements One would think it would be easy just to take glutathione as a pill but the body digests protein so you wouldn t get the benefits if you did it this way However the production and recycling of glutathione in the body requires many different nutrients and you CAN take these Here are the main supplements that need to be taken consistently to boost glutathione Besides taking a multivitamin and fish oil supporting my glutathione levels with these supplements is the most important thing I do every day for my personal health 4 N acetyl cysteine This has been used for years to help treat asthma and lung disease and to treat people with life threatening liver failure from Tylenol overdose In fact I first learned about it in medical school while working in the emergency room It is even given to prevent kidney damage from dyes used during x ray studies 5 Alpha lipoic acid This is a close second to glutathione in importance in our cells and is involved in energy production blood sugar control brain health and detoxification The body usually makes it but given all the stresses we are under we often become depleted 6 Methylation nutrients folate and vitamins B6 and B12 These are perhaps the most critical to keep the body producing glutathione Methylation and the production and recycling of glutathione are the two most important biochemical functions in your body Take folate especially in the active form of 5 methyltetrahydrofolate B6 in active form of P5P and B12 in the active form of methylcobalamin 7 Selenium This important mineral helps the body recycle and produce more glutathione 8 A family of antioxidants including vitamins C and E in the form of mixed tocopherols work together to recycle glutathione 9 Milk thistle silymarin has long been used in liver disease and helps boost glutathione levels So use these nine tips and see how they work to help you optimzie your glutathione levels When you do you will take one more step to lifelong vibrant health Now I d like to hear from you Had you ever heard of this important nutrient before Have you

       "  u\"{title:So you re a cyborg now what so you're a cyborg -- now what? - cnn.com so you're a cyborg -- now what? - cnn.com,body:STORY HIGHLIGHTS Scientists have two ideas of memory 1 Stable and closed 2 Changing and open The brain has about 1 billion neurons experts say Context is key in memory encoding in humans emotion makes it more poignant Atlanta Georgia CNN Quick What s the fattiest system in your body that has two halves and weighs between 2 and 4 pounds It s your brain you know that thing that remembers stuff But because of rapidly evolving information technology your first impulse was probably to search for the answer on the Internet As we become ever more dependent on external sources of memory using GPS to guide our driving smartphones to keep our schedules it s time to rethink our ideas about what memory actually is While we don t physically plug smartphones and other devices into our heads in some ways we re already one with them as evidenced by the anxiety we feel when we re without them Would you remember to pick up milk Would you know your parents phone numbers If you ve ever found yourself running late because you left your phone at home you might be a cyborg says Fred Trotter a blogger who spoke about information technology at the Health Journalism 2012 conference in April Brain implants that make you think of Avatar The Matrix and Star Trek may still be to come and scientists are working on ways that we can control devices with thoughts alone Researchers at Duke University last year for instance showed how a monkey could control a virtual arm with its brain as well as feel sensations the appendage delivered But in some ways it doesn t matter that we re pushing buttons with our fingers instead of our thoughts We have become dependent on the networked devices that live in our pockets and colorful rubber cases rather than what s in our skulls They re really external extensions of our mind said Joseph Tranquillo associate professor of biomedical and electrical engineering at Bucknell University Tranquillo and his colleague in the humanities John Hunter spoke about the tension between technology and memory at the Neuro Humanities Entanglement Conference at Georgia Tech in April where academics and thinkers from a variety of disciplines came together to discuss how their seemingly disparate areas of study might connect There are two models of memory they said One idea is that it s closed predictive static and stable such that what you put into the system never changes The other is that it s unstable dynamic open and contextual ever changing In reality memory as we know it fluctuates on the spectrum between these two extremes And digital technology is creating ever more tension between them What we remember A computer will save something for you when you hit command S For humans it s more complicated We have two kinds of memory short term or working memory which are the most fleeting recollections and then long term memory through which we can access perceptions of events in the distant past Scientists believe a brain region called the hippocampus is involved in short term memory A 2009 study in the Journal of Neuroscience suggests that by contrast the frontal temporal and parietal cortices all located on the surface of the brain are more active when recalling older memories So what makes a memory stay with you Experts say it s all about context When you save a text document on your computer your hard drive doesn t care whether it s a college application a poem that made you cry or an angry letter to your cable company The computer will save the file just the same and you can retrieve the document with an ease that is unrelated to its emotional content But with human memory emotional weight gives extra stickiness to experiences An almond shaped brain region called the amygdala involved in the flight or fight response has a big impact on memory processing connected with your feelings You probably remember exactly where you were when you learned about the World Trade Center attacks of September 11 2001 in a way that s more vivid than your recollection of lunch last Tuesday Similarly when your computer encodes images that you upload from your camera it does so irrespective of the subject matter of the photo But the research of Aude Oliva associate professor of brain and cognitive sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology has shown how memorable different images are to humans varies greatly by subject matter For instance you may think a photo of a landscape is pretty but you won t remember it as well if there aren t people or animals in it Suddenly this will give to that scenery a high level of memorability Oliva said This is the crowdsourced self As the viewer changes so does the collective construction of you Joseph Tranquillo And if there s an image of a person who s looking right at you that s likely to be a little more memorable than if the person s gaze is averted Similarly an image of two people interacting will stay with you longer than if they re not interacting What s going on here There are brain structures specific to facial recognition so we are extra attuned to remember seeing faces of other people The brain is tuned to look at other people and perhaps try to determine what they are thinking Studies have also found that when memories are similar they re more likely to be confused said Dr Gary Small director of the University of California Los Angeles Center on Aging and co author of the book iBrain Surviving the Technological Alteration of the Modern Mind But we do have the advantage of forming memories based on five senses sight smell taste touch and hearing notes Paul Nussbaum clinical neuropsychologist at the University of Pittsburgh These can also serve as reminders or provokers of past experiences Computers cannot at present reproduce the way your mother s salty chicken soup feels sliding down your sore throat despite your vivid recollection of it from childhood And that memory might come flooding back to your brain not your phone when you taste the soup again In other words it s a lot harder for the human brain to store random strings of data that have no particular context or emotion Computers can do this instantly but we still need our brains to help us give our experiences meaning Is memory unchanging or ever changing Regardless of the handiness of our smartphones we still rely on our memories to recall certain images and events that we did not record We d like to think that those memories are as much as possible true But here s the thing The way you encode memories depends on the state of your brain at that moment and the environmental context That means neural network changes forever and will never return to that exact state Tranquillo and Hunter said And when you recall something that changes your brain too The very act of remembering uses brain processes so you can never go back to the self that you were in the moment you re thinking about Pretty trippy right Technologies are emerging to help people document their lives digitally as never before For instance Microsoft developed a camera called SenseCam which captures photos of your visual experience all day every day Gordon Bell a Microsoft researcher wrote a book called Total Recall in 2009 after recording every aspect of his life for a decade You might think that digital memory is more stable at its core it s just a collection of 0s and 1s after all But like the brain technology is a constantly evolving open system subject to environmental influences On a small scale think about how files must be filtered to change formats With compression images and videos lose resolution and quality But programs can alter photos in ways that enhance them too The computer is reassembling and reprocessing the files in each of these cases And your computer may eventually break down purging your files which is why hard drive backups are recommended Social media also gives new meaning to digital storage Where you share a photo how it gets tagged and what its caption says all create a memory around the image that wouldn t exist otherwise Tranquillo said And your digital memory becomes influenced in even stranger ways now that there are social networking tools that update content without your direct intervention for instance posting on Facebook or Twitter when you arrive at a location With Facebook s Timeline feature other people can contribute to your online life history by posting photos videos and comments This is the crowdsourced self Tranquillo said As the viewer changes so does the collective construction of you Aiding the aging brain You may have at one point or another struggled with multitasking That s because when you move from one task to another your brain shuts down one neural circuit in order to move on to the next That s inefficient and studies have shown that it s harder for older adults to re establish that initial circuit and return to the first activity But if you use the Internet in ways that make your life more efficient it could theoretically reduce the multitasking that you do You don t have to fumble through an address book frantically or find your way out of an unfamiliar neighborhood unguided while thinking about other things That s important as the number of Americans with Alzheimer s disease currently 5 5 million continues to climb As people get older and their memory begins to decline they are still able to access information through search helping to compensate for their own memory deficits Small is working with computer scientists at UCLA on games that can help older people improve their ability to remember names and faces Plenty of research is in the works to find brain boosting pharmaceuticals supplements and foods most recently berries although nothing is a certain supplement We forget that all of the technology that built it came from the human brain Paul Nussbaum The dark side The downside of technology is that it can make us less thoughtful and less creative And we may spend less time communicating face to face which can reduce the quality of relationships A 2012 survey of American girls found that spending time multitasking with various digital devices watching video or communicating online is associated with abnormal social tendencies It s also not certain that freeing our memory from addresses and phone numbers frees up room to be more creative Tranquillo said What s more a lot of creative thinking depends on having ideas accessible in a way that preserves their context so merely writing them down to keep externally whether on a computer or a notebook doesn t necessarily allow you to do novel things with them Tapping storage potential It s not hard to appreciate how in terms of sheer volume computer memory has outpaced humans Google s Gmail offers 10 gigabytes of storage Tom Landauer professor of psychology at the University of Colorado at Boulder estimated in 1986 that the human brain holds 200 megabytes of information And what if we stored all of an individual s experience Landauer calculated that if a person only takes in one byte per second and lives about 25 000 days that s still only 2 gigabytes But that s just a tiny fraction of estimates for the brain s total storage capacity which is as high as 2 5 petabytes 2 6 million gigabytes based on the number of neurons 1 billion and connections to other neurons That sounds like a lot but McKinsey Global Institute estimated that consumers stored 7 exabytes 7 5 billion gigabytes of new data on PCs laptops and other devices in 2010 Obviously there is too much information out there to hope to compete with our minds against machines But there are certain things you can do to help your brain live a long healthy life so that you are using it to its fullest potential Engaging in activities that are new difficult and complex forces your brain to lay down new cellular connections Nussbaum said Exercise and healthy diet are also important to brain health Emerging research in meditation and spirituality has indicated that mindfulness practices associated with being in the present moment help too We tend to really get so impressed with the latest gadget the latest phone the latest whatever it is Nussbaum said and we forget that all of the technology that built it came from the human brain What is there left to remember that s not out there on the Internet You d better

       "  u'{url:cranberry health an unexpected ally eliminates chronic headaches 1804,title:An unexpected ally eliminates chronic headaches an unexpected ally eliminates chronic headaches,body:A prominent St Louis area dentist is waging a successful battle against the debilitating physical and emotional pain experienced by millions of chronic headaches sufferers many of whom have given up hope of ever being successfully treated Dr Daniel Sindelar head of the St Louis Headache Center is already well respected both in St Louis and nationally for his innovative and effective oral health practice Sindelar Dental offers no drill dentistry cosmetic treatments and all general dental services to patients of all ages Like his hometown often referred to as the Gateway to the West Dr Sindelar is at the forefront of a growing global community of health professionals who view the mouth as the gateway to improved overall physical well being Chronic headaches migraines TMJ D and other above the neck pains are actually more common than diabetes or asthma yet as many as half of Americans who have previously sought care have given up Worse millions of Americans who might benefit from the type of newly available treatments that Dr Sindelar is now providing have never even bothered to seek professional care Going to a dentist to fight persistent headaches is not yet the conventional choice Dr Sindelar readily acknowledges Yet the majority of headache patients that he and other specially trained oral health professionals are able to help have failed to respond to conventional medical treatments which often prescribe higher and higher does of ineffective pain killers including opiates For too many people painkillers work for a while but are like putting a bandage on a broken leg Dr Sindelar explains Our method is not designed to mask the pain but to eliminate the patient s headache at its source Dr Sindelar a second generation dentist who has practiced for more than 30 years received special advanced training along with his entire dental practice team in the TruDenta state of the art examination and headache treatment technologies The TruDenta system does not rely on prescription or over the counter medications Instead it permanently corrects unbalanced forces within the mouth head neck and jaw that often are the actual source of above the neck pains A typical TruDenta treatment in Dr Sindelar s office will last about 50 minutes with many delighted patients reporting significantly reduced headache pain and frequency after their very first visit Dr Sindelar makes patient safety his top priority He begins with a careful examination of new patients as well as a thorough assessment of their medical history to rule out the possibility of a serious underlying condition that should only be handled by a physician Most patients who suffer from headaches and migraines have a history of trauma even a long ago and mild instance such as bumping heads with a soccer ball as a youth or being involved in a low speed fender bender Such traumas when improperly diagnosed and treated are the actual cause of roughly 80 of all head neck and jaw pain The TruDenta system which features several proven FDA cleared technologies resets these force related ailments TruDenta is painless needle free and involves no medications whatsoever Depending upon the severity of the cause that Dr Sindelar identifies his patients are able to complete their headache relief programs in no more than 12 weekly visits often even fewer Once done patients report they achieve lasting relief with no further need for painkillers or office visits When their treatment is complete we pat them on the back send them on their way and let them live their lives to the fullest Dr Sindelar says Dr Sindelar a co founder and current president of the American Academy for Oral Systemic Health is the author of Refresh Life a book that spells out the many overall health benefits that can be realized when people take better care of their teeth and gums His establishment of the St Louis Headache Center which will serve patients throughout the region is consistent with his mission to provide each of his patients individualized attention along with beautiful healthy smiles and healthy bodies In addition to general and cosmetic dentistry Sindelar Dental provides patients solutions for insomnia as well as sinus problems including snoring Importantly Dr Sindelar s commitment to help prevent and manage periodontal disease enables him and his team to reduce their patients risks for Alzheimer s diabetes and cardiovascular disease Dr Sindelar anticipates that those who suffer from incurable headaches will initially be skeptical of his ability to help especially after other more conventional paths have proven to be dead ends Don t be afraid of being skeptical Dr Sindelar says In fact he welcomes skeptics offering them the opportunity to obtain a free St Louis Headache Center TruDenta brochure discuss their headaches with a qualified member of his team and even schedule an appointment for a free no obligation initial screening The science behind the St Louis Headache Center and TruDenta derives from proven methods used for year in sports rehabilitation to speed the recovery of world class athletes For the first time residents in and around St Louis don t have to be Olympians or sports stars to avail themselves of this effective painless once and forever headache cure says Dr Sindelar Those who overcome any initial skepticism and entrust us to manage their pain will come away headache free feeling as if they ve won life s gold medal The St Louis Headache Center or phone his friendly office at 314 849 1998 sindelar, headache, louis,

       "  u'{title:Shredded Chicken Enchiladas a sweet pea chef ,body:I don t make a whole lot of Mexican food at home mostly because I just find it just way too darn good at restaurants Now I do make some tasty fish tacos with pico de gallo homemade fajitas with steak or chicken and some really good breakfast burritos But for the most part I get my Mexican food cravings satisfied outside of my kitchen Plus it s usually difficult to make Mexican food Dustin will want to eat he s really a meat and cheese only on my burrito kinda guy I like the aut\\\\u00e9ntico type stuff to be made for me by the experts like chiles rellenos carne asada chili verde chilequiles machaca juevos rancheros and all those yummy things Ok now I need to go out and get me every one of those dishes I just mentioned stomach growling I ve actually never been a big fan of enchiladas at Mexican restaurants probably because I m already stuffing my face with all those other types of dishes I find most places add way too much cheese to their enchiladas I know I know and the problem with that is True cheese like bacon sour cream chocolate and guacamole but not together eww does tend to make everything better But I wanted to make an enchilada recipe at home that had more meat I suppose Dustin has trained me well So I started to make my own shredded chicken enchiladas at home Full disclosure I use store bought enchilada sauce Can you still love me I actually tried making it on my own from scratch but the final result didn t seem worth the hassle of dirtying all those dishes and cuz I can be lazy Maybe one day I will try it again but I really like how these enchiladas turn out pre made sauce and all I have actually made this shredded chicken enchiladas recipe often for my Personal Chef business as it freezes very well and is pretty simple to make The only thing I haven t been able to perfect with this recipe is that the darn tortillas have a tendency to fall apart on me I have tried all types of quality and non quality tortillas yet they don t withstand very well once they get filled and covered with sauce They certainly taste yummy which is ultimately what matters in my book but it would be nice to solve this dilemma So any suggestions are as always welcomed Shredded Chicken Enchiladas 2 cloves garlic minced1 can 1 1 2 cups enchilada sauce I use Mild kosher saltground black pepper2 boneless skinless chicken breasts1 cup shredded cheddar cheese divided1 cup shredded Monterrey jack cheese divided1 2 cup plus 1 tbsp fresh cilantro roughly chopped divided12 6 inch corn tortillascooking spray Directions Preheat oven to 425 degrees Add the minced garlic to the enchilada sauce in a deep skillet and heat to boiling Generously sprinkle kosher salt and ground black pepper over the chicken breasts and then nestle the chicken breasts into the sauce Reduce the heat to low cover and cook until the chicken is cooked through about 15 20 minutes Remove the chicken from the sauce set aside and let both the chicken and the sauce cool Using two forks shred the chicken breasts by holding one fork steady and slowly scraping the other fork prongs faced backwards away from the other fork see picture above Transfer the shredded chicken to a large bowl Add half the enchilada sauce 1 2 cup each of the Monterrey jack and cheddar cheeses and the 1 2 cup of cilantro to the shredded chicken Stir to combine Wrap the corn tortillas in a damp cloth or paper towel and microwave on high for 20 30 seconds until pliable and warm Using cooking spray if desired oil a 9 inch x 13 inch baking dish Spoon about 1 3 cup of the chicken mixture along the center of the tortilla Gently but firmly roll the tortilla around the filling and place into the baking dish seam side down Repeat with remaining tortillas Lightly spray the tortillas with cooking spray or brush lightly with olive oil This will help the tortillas turn golden in the oven and will also help keep them from cracking Place baking dish in the oven uncovered for 8 10 minutes or until the tortillas begin to turn golden Reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees Remove the baking dish from the oven Pour the remaining sauce over the enchiladas and sprinkle remaining cheese over the sauce Sprinkle with 1 tbsp fresh cilantro Lightly cover baking dish with aluminum foil and place into the oven for 20 minutes Carefully remove foil after 20 minutes and bake uncovered for an additional 5 10 minutes or until the cheese is golden Remove form the oven and let stand 5 10 minutes prior to serving Feel free to add a dollop or two of sour cream and some more chopped cilantro for a garnish if you d like Enjoy As always I want to thank you for visiting I welcome your comments questions recipe suggestions and food stories Here s to doing what you love a quick, easy and delicious homemade shredded chicken enchiladas recipe you can make for dinner tonight!

       "  u'{title:How to Wake Up Early The Definitive Guide ,body:Most successful people are early risers Think of Tiger Woods and Donald Trump One reason why waking up early is correlated with success is that you get more work done in the morning That s one benefit of waking up early But how do you build the habit of waking up early without feeling like a mess in the morning Especially if you re a night owl This post will give you 12 powerful tips to become an early riser within 30 days and wake up early consistently 1 Wake Up At The Same Time Daily You ll become an early riser by waking up at the exact same time for 30 days on You ll be less likely to sleep in and might even wake up right before your alarm goes off Here s how to get started Wake Up At The Same Time If you have problems catching sleep lying awake at night while feeling tired start by waking up at the same time daily Even if it s late This will stabilize your circadian rhythm Wake Up Earlier I recommend at least 2 hours before leaving for work I wake up at 6am to start working at 8am Many early risers wake up at 5am or even 4am Nap for 30mins around noon if you re tired Don t Gradually Wake Up Earlier You re body gets used to waking up early fast Don t wake up 15mins earlier every couple of days until you wake up when you want to Go directly for your goal wake up time 2 Set Your Alarm Use something loud but not annoying I use the alarm on my cellular phone off at night because I don t like music a radio or a buzzer Use whatever works for you Put your alarm out of arm reach so you can t hit the snooze to sleep in You must have to get out of bed to stop your alarm 3 Jump Out of Bed When Your Alarm Goes Off The longer it takes you to get up the more likely you ll try to sleep in And hitting the snooze to lay in your bed longer only makes it harder Get up the first time your alarm goes off Stop Rationalizing Don t lay in bed thinking of reasons to sleep longer Get out of bed even if you feel tired You need consistency to build the habit of waking up early Don t make exceptions Stop Snoozing Sleeping in for 10mins leads to another 10mins Before you know it you ve slept 2h more And because you broke your sleep any extras are low quality and can make you even more tired Leave The Room Have a warm sweater or a bathrobe ready if it s cold season Then leave the room and don t come back Ignore the voice in your head that tells you to go back to sleep in 4 Get Light Exposure Light stimulates dopamine production which increases energy motivation productivity Lack of light causes winter blues tiredness Unfortunately home office lights aren t bright enough You need sunlight Open Window Blinds This gets you sunlight exposure when you wake up and during the day If you work in an office open the window blinds and place your desk so your eyes get sunlight exposure Walk Outside A 30 min walk in the morning sunlight will stimulate the production of dopamine Do not wear sunglasses UV is low at sunset Your eyes will be safe unless you look directly into the sun Use a Sun Box If your place doesn t have big windows to let sunlight in or if it s winter cloudy or if you can t get outside in the morning then use a light box like this one for 30mins after you wake up 5 Have a Reason To Wake Up Early Use your extra time in the morning to do things that matter Not for surfing the Internet or doing other tasks that won t make a difference in the long term Here s what I recommend Eat Breakfast Key to building healthy eating habits you ll be less likely to eat junk food the rest of the day if you eat a healthy breakfast Read the benefits of breakfast and build the habit of eating on waking up Cook Food Preparing your own meals gives you total control over their ingredients and thus over your results Prepare breakfast and your food for the day on waking up This takes about 1 hour Exercise You won t miss workouts if you train in the morning whatever comes up you ve already trained Wait 1hour before lifting weights This gives your spine time to dehydrate and lowers risks of lower back injury 6 Write Your Goals Daily Most people don t have goals And those who set some forget about them within weeks By writing down your goals daily you ll never forget them and they ll be your reason for waking up early Set Goals If you don t know what you want start with what you don t want Your goal is the opposite Aim high choose 1 goal and be specific Example I don t want to be fat I choose to have 10 body fat Know Why You Want It Avoiding pain frustration is the best motivator Compare the pain of waking up early to staying fat skinny experiencing humiliation as a result and dying young because of your unhealthy diet Write Your Goals 2x Day On waking up and before going to bed Use them as affirmations read Beyond Positive Thinking I choose to easily wake up at 6am I choose to eat breakfast and exercise each morning 7 Build a Morning Ritual This daily routine will get you strong for your day by setting the right context read Power of Full Engagement and is your reason to wake up early Mix tips 1 to 6 and do them daily in the same order Example Wake up at 6am Drink water Open window blinds windows Eat breakfast and cook your food for day Review your goals and write them down Go the gym come back eat shower get ready for work 8 Commit For 30 Days It takes about 30 days to build a new habit Commit yourself to wake up at the exact same time for at least 30 days weekends included Consistency is the only way to build a habit Use Willpower You ll meet lots of internal resistance during the first 10 days Use willpower to get through these It gets easier once you begin experiencing the benefits which is after about 20 days Focus on 1 Habit Changing many things at once usually leads nowhere Start with waking up early eating breakfast and exercising Once you do this consistently for 30 days you can build another habit Be Consistent Self discipline isn t something you re born with You build it Waking up early will build self discipline which you ll be able to use to build other habits It starts here Don t skip a day No matter what 9 Go To Bed When You re Sleepy How much sleep you need depends on your activity levels sleep quality diet But you ll most likely need 8h sleep night on average Which means some days 6h some days 9h That s why going to bed at the same time each day won t work Focus on wake up time not bedtime Listen to your body and go to bed when you feel sleepy Avoid anything that prevents you to feel tiredness Tips Get Downtime Pre bed Stop working internet surfing watching TV 1h before you go to bed Read a book and go to sleep when you can t read without losing concentration Or do meditations and breathing exercises If you think a lot in bed write it all down so it gets out of your head Set Bedtime Deadline Staying up late makes it hard to wake up early You ll usually end up sleeping in and quit Set a bedtime deadline and go to bed at that time even if you re not tired yet No matter what Stop Trying to Sleep If You Can t If it takes you longer than 10mins to fall asleep you re not tired enough Stop trying and keep yourself busy Read a book or do some meditations Don t stress about it 10 Get Quality Sleep Deep sleep REM are quality sleep You ll wake up more easily need less sleep and have more energy if you have uninterrupted quality sleep Tips to improve your sleep quality Stop Stimulants Coffee alcohol nicotine mess with your sleep Drink green tea instead of coffee water instead of alcohol Stop smoking Avoid Big Meals Pre bed They ll stress your digestive system and lower your sleep quality Have a small pre bed snack Don t wake up at night to eat you won t lose muscle starvation mode is a myth Avoid Drinking Pre bed Waking up to go to the toilet interrupts your sleep and lowers its quality Stop drinking water 2h prior bedtime Avoid Exercise Pre bed Exercising less than 3 hours prior bedtime can keep you awake Schedule your workout earlier Set Right Conditions Good mattrass pillow Cool dark silent room wear ear plugs a sleeping mask if you have to No electronics Check the Power Sleep Program for a definitive guide on how to improve your sleep quality so you feel more energized productive while sleeping less 11 Make Yourself Accountable If people commit orally or in writing they ll be more likely to honor that commitment Even if motivation is removed after they ve agreed they ll continue to honor the agreement Robert Cialdini Influence This is because you tend to care about other people s opinion and don t want to be embarassed for failing Although I advise to stop caring about what people think here s where it can be useful Tell family or close friends you re going to wake up early for 30 days Make a deal that if you don t wake up early each day for 30 days you ll do something you don t want to do like writing them a 1000 check Report to them daily for 30 days call text or email them And if you skip once stick to the deal you ve agreed on If you re thinking I d never do that that s because you know that making this kind of commitment will force you to follow through Proof this works 12 Stop Believing The Myths I always thought I was an evening person As a student I woke up past noon unless it was school Then I started to wake up earlier to go the gym but anything before 8AM was still killing me About a year ago I built the habit of waking up at 6AM because I realized that you get more done if you wake up early I ve been waking up consistently at 6AM since And now I see that the whole morning person thing is a myth There s nothing like a morning or night person Human bodies can adapt to anything You just have to be consistent to get used to waking up early Start tomorrow Don t deviate You ll become an early riser within 30 days Please share this post now so more guys discover how to train correctly discover 12 powerful tips to build the habit of waking up early within 30 days and becoming an early riser. wake up early, how to wake up early, waking up early, wake up early how to, waking up early tips, early riser,url:stronglifts how

       "  u\"{title:Want an Adventure Beach Camping in Puerto Rico ,body:It was the thunderous sound that startled me awake I jolted upright in my sleeping bag my head banging against the pole above my head As I reached for my glasses tucked into the tent pocket his hand gently grabbed my wrist and the red glow of his night vision headlamp beamed across our enclosed cocoon We re OK Sandy my boyfriend John said It s just the waves I grinned foolishly relaxing as I breathed in the salty sea air that billowed through our tent flaps It had been my idea to buy spur of the moment tickets to San Juan Puerto Rico which thanks to JetBlue came in at under 300 a person from NYC And so now we found ourselves on a beach in the off the radar town of A\\\\u00f1asco Puerto Rico Our challenge Spend as little as possible Our strategy Spend nothing on accommodations Our rule Only one Safety first With that set out we rented the cheapest car we could find on the island a Kia from U Save Car Rental which came in at 380 for eight days With John behind the wheel and me acting as the human GPS we zipped out of San Juan and headed towards the paradise of big swell surfing in Rincon But instead of stopping I directed us south of the heady bohemia and towards the town of A\\\\u00f1asco which boasts only two mini grocery stores three bars and one abandoned camping ground that could have dubbed as a set for Lost s Dharma Initiative La Playa de Tres Hermanos Upon entering the park we were greeted by a man named Javier an alleged park employee who told me that the area was muy seguro very safe and no te preocupes don t worry And yet unsettingly the sign that welcomed us said otherwise Loosely translated this sign reads Warning to the public After 6 PM the Agency is not responsible for property and security Deciding to ignore the aged sign and trust Javier I popped up the tent while John patrolled up and down the beach Deeming it safe we crawled in and began calling Playa Tres Hermanos our home Over the next few days I swam with a racehorse who is exercised on the beach daily met a 90 year old woman who was born on the very sand we stood on showered at a surf shop and skinny dipped every morning Best of all We were the only campers It was the ultimate beach camping vacation and I d recommend it to anyone looking for an adventurous and cheap getaway Ready to start planning Here are my five tips for success 1 Plan Before You Go You can play almost everything about your beach vacation by ear except a car rental prices are seriously jacked up once you re on the island We searched around 10 different websites before finding U Save to be the cheapest I also recommend booking as far in advance as possible as we saw prices hike up just over one week of searching Also if you go during peak season over the holidays be prepared to pay more for a vehicle Although all guidebooks and the National Park website in Puerto Rico suggest making reservations you don t have to at Tres Hermanos There is no check in or site management and calling ahead to ask about reservations confirmed that none were needed If you re calling for another campsite good luck if you don t speak Spanish Try acampar and reservacion 2 Safety First Harking back to our one and only rule we were vigilant about our surroundings at night I would speak to the locals who came down during the day to form relationships learn from them and ask if the area was safe We also had a lot of muscle John a loud voice me and a switchblade don t tell JetBlue with us just in case I m pretty adventurous ladies but I don t suggest camping alone 3 What to Bring For Camping A great tent and a sleeping bag are a must for this site Unlike the maintained camping sites on the island like Flamenco Beach in Culebra you ve got to bring your own stuff For its small size fast set up for the camping neophyte and feather light weight I recommend any of REI s two person three season two door tents And I ve said it before and I ll say it again headlamps are absolutely clutch for camping They re your guide to the bathroom a k a the woods your reading lamp and a strobe light all in one 4 What to Bring For You If you don t think you need personal care essentials for a camping trip think again Baby wipes bug spray deodorant sun block and hair gel are key The bugs on a beach at night are intense not showering can lead to foul smelling situations and no one wants a sunburn on vacation Usually the mix of bug spray sunblock and ocean water will cover up your sweat smell but just in case deodorant and scrunching up your wet hair into sweet curls can help you hold on to a touch of classiness try Matrix Curl Boucles Other than that well learn to embrace your inner dash of hippie 5 Where to Eat

       "  u'{title:How The Mainstream Media Stole Our News Story Without Credit ,body:On Friday I broke a tasty story about a woman suing Google claiming bad directions caused her to get hit by a vehicle Today I discover our story is everywhere often with no attribution Come along and watch how the mainstream media which often claims bloggers rip it off does a little stealing of its own Woman Follows Google Maps Walking Directions Gets Hit Sues was the story I posted on Friday afternoon Pacific Time I was tipped to the lawsuit by Gary Price of ResourceShelf Gary hadn t written about it himself but thought Search Engine Land would be interested in it He came across it through the regular monitoring of search related news that he does across a variety of resources Gary watches many many things he s a research guru extraordinaire Gary downloaded a copy of the suit via the PACER Service and sent it to me No one had written about the case before I put my article up I know I checked before publishing There was nothing out there So what happened next I ll Steal Your Image But I Won t Link To You Let s start with the Daily Mail s story here We get no attribution but I know they found the story from us My evidence They re using a screenshot I made without my permission and without credit It s a screenshot of the route from Google Maps Sure the Daily Mail could have generated their own route using Google Maps But they didn t Their image is cropped exactly the same as mine and includes an arrow I added to point to a warning on Google Maps Since the image was created by me for Search Engine Land and is a transformation of the original Google work the copyright that the Daily Mail is violating belongs to Search Engine Land Postscript There s some debate in the comments on whether altering a Google screenshot as I did provides me with a copyright Let s say it doesn t That still doesn t excuse the Daily Mail in my books for just taking the picture without any credit at all Common courtesy still has a place The Financial Post does the same thing uses my exact image so they had to have seen my story but they don t bother to link over or provide attribution Postscript Jameson Berkow from the Financial Post got in touch soon after I posted my story to apologize saying there was originally a link to our article in his piece but which got lost along with other links through some technical glitch which I can totally understand happening I ve lived through those myself When he fixed the missing links ours got overlooked accidentally but now has been restored I m also good with the usage of our illustration since the article links over to me I ll Link To Your Source Document But Not You Over at PC World a different twist Rather than link to my story they linked to the source documentation the lawsuit that I uploaded to my personal Scribd account I created this account on Friday so it s not something you d just stumble upon in the course of independent news gathering Maybe PC World saw someone else linking to it and so never saw my story Maybe Then again as part of the news reporting process I think tracking down originating sources is important Where did this document come from The Scribd file links over to my original story If you wanted to backtrack the origin of this document say perhaps to know if it was actually real you d probably head over to my story Either PC World did this and didn t think credit was necessary or it failed to fully fact check the story Postscript PC World has added a link now thanks and the author commented about coming across my story after finding other ones about it By Omission Someone Else Becomes The Source Regardless of how it happened the PC World story is an example of something else how a second party can become the originating source That PC World story CBS News cited it as the source for its own story That again makes you question some of the news reporting that is supposed to go on by the mainstream media The reporting that accounts often say blogs themselves fail to do CBS simply seems to have summarized the PC World story ending with a link to PC World plus a link to the complaint itself the complaint I uploaded Clearly no one tried to track down the complaint s origin more No apparent attempt to independently verify if the case was real FYI unlike CBS I actually did call the legal firm in the case on Friday That CBS story also flowed out to affiliated CBS news stations such as here and here Postscript CBS after seeing this added a link thanks Over at the Atlantic Wire PC World again gets cited but not us News com also is cited in that Atlantic Wire round up of commentary on the case Despite the fact News com prominently links to us thanks that doesn t make it into the Atlantic s story Postscript They ve since added a link thanks Time Magazine also does the same linking to the Scribd document and the PC World story Postscript They ve since added a link thank you AOL News did similarly linking to the complaint which was almost certainly found by reading our story but not to our story itself As a result places like the New York Daily News nineMSN and The Register cite AOL News as the source Postscript AOL has since added a link thanks It s not just mainstream media that screwed up however Even Gizmodo a well known tech blog overlooked us They linked to Fortune which in turn linked to us But we didn t get a mention at Gizmodo Postscript Originally I d had written further below Semi thanks to Gizmodo They linked to Fortune which linked to us But hey Gizmodo next time show a brother blog some love and give us a direct link It came up in comments that this was being too soft on Gizmodo compared to some of the mainstream publications that I dinged for linking to an intermediary source I agreed explained why this happened and have changed the story to ding them properly Having said that about an hour after this story when live Gizmodo added us as a source like this Search Engine Land via Fortune I ve often seen them show the story trail across multiple sources this way which I think is well done Want to see attribution done right Over at Inc they appared to have spotted the PC World story first But further down there s this First reported by SearchEngineLand Thanks And thanks to others who linked including The News It Just Sprang From Our Forehead Though I m a traditionally trained reporter most of my journalism has been online where documenting how a story has been found is both easily done through links and often done Bloggers generally explain how they discovered a news item As a result bloggers also set themselves up for accusations that they ve just ripped off some traditional news outlet By carefully listing an originating source and sometimes a via source they expose how news flows In contrast a traditional media outlet typically does not document how a story came to life It s all a mystery News just seems to emerge magically out of thin air in the middle of a newsroom Or it s down to all those hard working reporters out there defending democracy despite newspapers earning less these days because of all those rip off bloggers For example the Salt Lake Tribune published the Google Maps story yesterday three days after our story went up How did the paper discover the news In a lawsuit filed last week in U S District Court for Utah Well lawsuits are public Newspapers regularly check on them in their areas In fact that s exactly what Tribune reporter Chris Smart told me when I called him today to ask about the origin of his story Smart said the Tribune has a federal courts reporter who checks for filings each day I used to work for daily newspapers I know courts reporters do this But our story went up late on Friday afternoon Pacific time How come the Tribune didn t have its own story then A full day had passed from when the case was filed to when it could have been written up But it wasn t Did the reporter come in on Saturday Sunday or Monday over a holiday weekend and check the records There was some discussion between Chris and someone else in the newsroom then I was handed over to the federal courts reporter herself She eventually said that someone in the newsroom heard a rumor about this case and she was called in to help locate it on Monday using the PACER system Now let s imagine how the Tribune s story would have looked if that fact had been reported After hearing a rumor about a case involving Google Maps which someone saw on TV or read on a blog or we don t really know where we checked court records ourselves to find the case which says Whatever rumor the Tribune heard which finally got them to cover a story three days late in their own backyard that rumor started with our story Despite this the Tribune became the originating source as cited by places such as About com the San Francisco Business Times and elsewhere Postscript The SF Business Times after seeing this kindly added a link Beyond the Tribune there are plenty of other places where the story was apparently just discovered out of the blue including I especially like how this happens over at The Sun The story there by Staff Reporter gives no clue about how a British tabloid owned by News Corporation came across a story that happened over 5 000 miles away Wire report Saw it on a blog Is there a Sun reporter based in Park City Utah We ll Cite You But Not Link To You Mashable reported on our story and like a reputable blog they linked to us But Mashable s content appears to be syndicated into places like the Sydney Morning Herald and our link got dropped in that That s bad for us as we lose traffic It s also bad for Sydney Morning Herald readers who may want to read our original story Postscript They ve since added a link thank you Related to this both Fox News Memphis and Fox News LA cite Mashable for their story which makes me think all Fox News affiliates are sharing this piece Since Mashable is credited was it too hard to cite Search Engine Land as the original source Postscript The story has since added a link thanks The Salt Lake Tribune also gets cited which underscores a point I made earlier Instead of original reporting going on plenty of mainstream publications are happy to simply echo chamber a story that originated on a blog in the same way that blogs are often accused of doing to mainstream publications And Now It s From The AP The Associated Press has filed on the story Here s the entire thing so far the story will no doubt grow as they do more reporting I m going to reprint the entire thing I feel this is allowed by fair use as it s required to show the entire story in order to fully comment about it PARK CITY Utah AP A woman who says she relied on Google for walking directions in Utah that got her hit on a major roadway has filed a lawsuit against the Internet company claiming it supplied unsafe directions Lauren Rosenberg filed the 100 000 lawsuit Thursday in U S District Court in Utah It also names a motorist she says hit her A Google spokeswoman also did not return a message from The Associated Press seeking comment Rosenberg says she used her BlackBerry to download walking directions from Google Maps between two Park City addresses The Los Angeles County resident claims the directions led her to walk through Park City on a road without sidewalks that she says isn t safe for pedestrians Rosenberg couldn t be reached Tuesday Her attorneys did not return messages As with the Tribune where s the information about how the AP discovered this story Did the reporter come across someone else writing about it If so how about a credit And if so did they actually pull the case itself from PACER Or did they download the document I put out there like many others seem to have done Speaking of the Tribune that paper is owned by MediaNewsGroup which is led by Dean Singleton who is also chairman of the Associated Press Singleton and the AP have been vocal that blogs often rip them off for news content My Do Newspapers Owe Google Fair Share Fees For Researching Stories story has another example of a story that emerged from blogs and into the AP wire without attribution I think that if the AP or traditional publications like the Salt Lake Tribune documented exactly how they found news in the way blogs do there d be a fair reassessment of just how much flows back and forth It s not all a one way street from traditional news outlets to blogs Can t We All Get Along That brings me back to another piece I wrote last year Blogs Mainstream Media We Can Do Get Along I d like to see a lot less finger pointing and much more acknowledgment that the origin of news is a messy business So why am I pointing fingers in this case To help keep things even I think it s very well known how traditional sources get cited by alternative ones But while the opposite is true that s a story that s rarely illustrated I ll also add that I know mistakes and misunderstandings can happen with attribution I try to get it right but I know I m not perfect I also know there are times we ve reported on a story credited someone else but nonetheless ended up as a originating source News is messy But we should all try to do better attribution Postscript Aside from the fairness of attribution linking to sources brings those sources support with traffic Our story at Search Engine Land has had 30 000 page views just from being mentioned in the Toronto Star s write up If other places like the Daily Mail or the Sun had linked we d have even more visitors which is important to a relatively small publication My Thanks For The Link Mainstream Media Now Let s Have More post from 2007 has more thoughts on wanting to see more mainstream linking ,url:daggle mainstream media stole news story credit 1906}',\n",

       "  u\"{title:Full of Sound and Fury Signifying Nothing ,body:May 31 2011 No wonder we re struggling we re given tales told by idiots as news and interpretation The Mainstream Media has completely failed to make sense of the global financial crisis By make sense I mean a framework of interpretation that properly attributes responsibility to the causes and players and which explains the key dynamics in common language A framework of interpretation doesn t disappear in the next news cycle it is constantly reinforced by additional interpretation and illumination The news cycle now lasts at best the length of a playoff series Mr bin Laden s news cycle didn t even last as long as an NBA playoff the demise of the most dangerous man in the world was shoved into the ashbin of history within a few days with little interpretation beyond fist pumping and a few fusty pontifications by the usual suspects i e the experts trotted out during big events to explain it all away The full quote from Macbeth Act V Scene V It is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing Every news event is terribly important until a few hours later it is unimportant This is a form of madness a madness which goes unrecognized in the crazed turbulent flood of news To be sure a handful of people within the Mainstream Media which now includes the Web aggregators such as HuffPo AOL do labor away at an honest account but these reports are either buried beneath an avalanche of dross or they are touted briefly of course as the Media s Potemkin Village you see we really are doing good journalism here The ugly truth is the Mainstream Media now depends on adverts aimed at the top 10 of the populace for its survival It s all well and good to talk about journalism blah blah blah but I ve got a kid in private school and a mortgage and the last thing this news organization needs is to undermine the advertisers by calling the entire Status Quo into question Simply put the top 10 of households are the ones paying the media s bills Their consumption of goodies accounts for 40 of the entire U S economy and so advertising rather naturally skews to serve their desires and aspirations The debt serfs and tax donkeys below I raise my hand here may have aspirations to the lux life but with the home ATM shut down costs for essentials floating ever higher and earnings in decline their discretionary income approximates a shovel full of snow dumped on Death Valley asphalt in July Local television stations limp along until a new election cycle disgorges a wave of pricey electioneering Elections are an essential profit center for TV Do you reckon that colors their coverage of the travesty of a mockery of a sham that is American politics Of course it does the Media is itself dependent on the charade being treated as terribly important when it is all just a money driven tale told by idiots full of sound and fury signifying nothing The essential framework of intepretation that is missing from the Mainstream Media is that the Status Quo is unsustainable and profound changes cannot be avoided But rather than assemble a framework which might help us understand our limited pallette of hard choices the Media distracts us with a frenzy of gossip brightly packaged news that looks just like marketing and circus like thrills and spills to entertain us between the clash of gladiators A handful of commentators understand this and a few of those are occasionally given a bit of space amid the cacophany again to burnish the Potemkin Village image of the media as responsible and providing a wide range of voices blah blah blah David Stockman is such a voice relegated to the back pages buried links or financial section where it can be overshadowed by the earnings surprises and rising profits stories David Stockman Reagan economist on debt spree The truth is that the Media is terrified of the coming transformation Dependent as they are on adverts aimed at the top 10 with a few grocery circulars for the bottom 90 to paw over looking for bargains the idea that the entire edifice is crumbling leaves them with no lifeline There is a lifeline but they are too afraid to see it you could tell the truth The truth is difficult but it is something some people would pay for It is after all one of the essentials of life There is another idiot in the room search engines which reward aggregation of meaningless sound and fury If the Google et al algorithms weighted original content as a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 and any aggregated links to that content a 0 or a 1 then that would instantly change the incentives of the game of attracting eyeballs and thus advertisers Right now an aggregated link to this entry places higher in a search of the title than my own site which is a Page Rank 5 site i e it has a lot of strong links in and a lot of content That is a snapshot of what is pushing the Media to spewing ever louder and more meaningless sounds and furies If all the major search engines relegated aggregator links to the basement and rewarded original content that would help right the sinking ship The Mainstream Media is boxed in by its old models and its fear of the future As its subscriber base melts away it turns to precisely the worst strategy which is marketing to the top 10 of the populace which supports its advertising base and giving that top tranch what they want to hear everything s gonna be fine profits are rising we have a great lineup for Fall the latest fashions are gotta have and all the other idiot s chatter of marketing which signifies nothing By offering up an idiot s delight of content and fawning support of the Status Quo story there is no need to transform anything everything s fixed there s plenty of everything forever technology will seamlessly provide solutions to every vexing problem our system healthcare politics etc is the finest in the world etc the Media and its search engine

out of the country for the next eleven days I can certainly fend for myself nutritionally but I m probably not going to get too culinarily ambitious I find I either want to cook for lots and lots of folks hence my two dinner parties over the weekend or not really mess with it I mean who I am gonna impress and treat Myself Nah Plus I gotta do all the cleanup myself So while I promised myself I won t get take out every night I m prolly not gonna make a big mess in the kitchen with fancy fixings And probably at least once when spending an evening huddled away in the basement working on a project I ll resort to that single guy staple the frozen pizza Not that I like frozen pizza of course But it does do in a pinch requires little effort and clean up and sorta feels like a treat But that bland blagh from a box doesn t have to be all bad Especially if you take it up a notch with some fresh ingredients and clever techniques There are four major components on any pizza the crust the sauce the cheese and the toppings Unfortunately in most frozen pizzas each of these components is usually lacking resulting in a substandard pie So address each element individually and you re well on your way for a passable even respectable meal The crust 1 Frozen pizza dough is totally different than fresh dough Since it s flash frozen and has been hanging out in the freezer for whoknowshowlong frozen dough tends to turn out limp no matter how hot your oven since there are so many ice crystals in the dough sauce even the cheese and toppings The pizza essential steams rather than bakes So in this case it s best to let it touch as little of a surface as is possible and that means the oven rack Forget your pizza stones your baking sheets your special pizza pans Just slide the frozen pie directly onto the rack positioned in the second from the bottom position Going from the dry cold of your freezer to the dry heat of the oven is your best bet for any hope of a crispy crust 2 If your pizza comes wrapped in plastic which they almost always do try this trick Before you unwrap it flip it over onto the box or other flat surface and take the plastic off just the back Use a fork or paring knife to punch little holes or dock the dough in the center where the toppings are This will allow the steam to escape and result in a much less limp crust 3 Up the flavor of your outer crust just before finishing cooking When there s about two minutes left brush the outer ring of crust with garlic butter garlic oil or a bit of olive oil and a sprinkle of black pepper and parmesean cheese Allow it to brown in the oven which should also help the crispiness factor Lastly rub a clove of raw garlic over the browned crust garlic bread style for a big flavor boost The sauce 4 Unfortunately this is the toughest one since you simply can t get at that lake of frozen sauce stuck between the crust and the cheese So the trick is add sauce like things to the pizza when done A drizzle of high quality extra virgin olive oil a sprinkle of fresh herbs like basil and oregano some dried chile flakes or fresh tomatoes all work wonders Yeah sure they re technically toppings but they bring an extra punch of sauce y flavor whether red or white The cheese 5 This is the most obvious one add more cheese Or rather add better cheese Throwing in some fresh mozzarella beware the water content or at least a higher quality Italian cheese blend what you d use on a homemade pizza will getcha that ooey gooeyness that we know from you know good pizzas These are never gonna be artisinal pies that let the simplicity shine so you might as well enjoy yourself and go cheese crazy 6 In addition try adding more complex cheeses to the relatively overly sweet taste of most frozen pizza You may be tempted to salt a frozen pizza DON T The sodium content on these guys are already out of the roof If your pizza is bland it s not cause it isn t salty It s because it s very uh one note namely packaged low quality pizza So add some complexity with different cheeses A grating of good parmigiano or romano will bring that saltiness you re looking for but also a bit of nuttiness and even some sour notes that will cut through that overly sweetened corn syrupy sauce Or try some soft feta or farmer s cheese for a contrast with the melty The toppings 7 More is more Here s where you can really improve these frostbitten beasts Basically any fresh ingredients you can add here will be an improvement over the frozen little nuggets that came with it Go classic or use your imagination Adding traditional flavors like tomato fresh herbs higher quality meats and salumi will always be tasty Fresh or lightly sauteed grilled veggies are a must and frozen veggies like peas and corn work quite well Try raiding your fridge look for olives or capers and use up those leftovers Rostiserrie chicken or leftover lunch meat will bring some protein and some chopped onion always adds a nice crunch If you can t stand the strength of raw onion try rinsing it in a sieve or colander under cold water for about twenty seconds It ll take away the sting and leave you with a good balance of flavor and texture One of my favorite tricks is to squirt a basic red and white pizza with some homemade or jarred pesto It s a great way to use up pesto before it oxidizes and brings plenty of flavor to the party 8 Go nuts Or well add some Toss on some toasted pinenuts walnuts slivered almonds etc for a big protein boost plenty of roasty flavor and a bit of texture 9 Get jet set Sure pizza is traditionally understood as having Italian like flavors but tomatoes and cheese are everybodys friends Add some goat cheese thyme and figs for a French flair or plenty of olives feta oregano and a squirt of lemon for a taste of Greece I often add fresh cilantro black beans corn Mexican style hot sauce and a bit of queso fresco for a Latin punch It works Really 10 Add a salad Fresh greens atop a pizza is a tasy thing indeed and a surefire way to make frozen pizza a complete meal Toss some tender greens like argula spring or mesclun mix in fresh lemon juice or light vinegar olive oil course salt and lots of black pepper Then just plant it atop your slices and enjoy Do you have any favorite tricks for amping up frozen pizza Post em in the comments below Images by taste book all things nice active life cooking Sign up

       "  u'{title:Marnia Robinson Intercourse vs Orgasm intercourse vs. orgasm intercourse vs. orgasm,body:Not long ago a Canadian research team discovered something surprising In the recipe for great sex orgasm is optional Said the head researcher There is plenty of evidence that most people believe that the secret to sexual fulfillment is technical that it s about better manual and oral stimulation techniques In fact You could have terrible sex with orgasms and despite orgasms but you could have optimal sexuality without orgasm So where did humans get the idea that sex must always lead to orgasm At first I suspected our primitive mammalian mating program which delivers a reinforcing Yes with each climax Turns out there s more to the story Both the Church and the experts who compiled the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM have contributed to the belief that intercourse must be fertilization driven or orgasm driven Church father Augustine of Hippo b 354 CE is well known for his prayer Grant me chastity and continence but not yet Less well known is his conclusion that because sex is a consequence of the animal in man and animals have no interest in using sex to foster love or unity the proper use of sex in marriage is strictly for breeding Whoa Actually the infamous bonobo chimps whose males sport supersize testicles to produce lots of competitive sperm nevertheless engage in rather casual and relaxed sexual activity for social bonding frequently without orgasm And macaque male monkeys ejaculate in scarcely half of their copulations That s probably more than the Church fathers would have wanted to know but the point is that primate sex often serves goals other than fertilization or orgasm Augustine s error has been used to fend off some of sex s most uplifting gifts In the last century when Belgian and French Catholics discovered that gentle intercourse without orgasm was a means of achieving a more perfect more spiritual conjugal love the pope condemned it Some Church authorities actually declared incomplete sexual acts mortal sins When it comes to orgasm Church authorities are not the only conservatives Whenever I ve asked experts about doing a few weeks of research comparing the stress levels or healing speeds of couples engaging in orgasm based sex with couples practicing gentle intercourse without the goal of orgasm I received the same advice That wouldn t get past our ethics committee because sex without orgasm is considered a paraphilia or sexual disorder However this pro orgasm experiment passed electrical devices were implanted in women s spines to see if they would produce climaxes via remote control Now I have no doubt that people have sometimes avoided orgasm during sex for pathological reasons But benefits from the practice of gentle intercourse without orgasm have been reported so often and in so many cultures that emotionally healthy people must have made this choice too In any event are our codified convictions serving lovers They create unnecessary distress and frustration in the less orgasmic or anorgasmic and their mates They also indirectly bolster the assumption that pursuing sexual urges to exhaustion is a neutral or even beneficial practice For instance a man recently assured me that men ejaculate 1 3 times a day Persuaded as he is that men are veritable semen fountains he might be startled to learn that when subjects engaged in mere a 10 day depletion experience ejaculating an average of 2 4 times per day their sperm output remained below pre depletion levels for more than five months What other not so welcome subtle changes accompany this one given the powerful influence of our delicate reward circuitry the brain mechanism behind our drives on equilibrium and mood I suspect that orgasm feels great not because it is an unqualified health or psychological benefit but because our genes want us to expend our effort on their top priority propelling them into the next generation The neurochemical Yes of climax may not indicate that we re equipped to engage in orgasm driven sex every time we feel sexual desire Just as a love of fine chocolate doesn t mean that we d be wise to eat an entire box A 20 year old found this out the hard way We knew we weren t going to see each other for a while so we had sex 4 times in the night and once in the morning The next day I had weird feelings like I was pulling away from her or didn t want her or something which cannot be because I know I love this girl I feel very fatigued light headed or zoned out and depressed This is not like me As I learn more about the effects of sex on the brain I realize it makes sense to take into account how recently or intensely we have climaxed It appears that frequent or especially intense orgasm can create tolerance a need for increasing stimulation to achieve future orgasms It can also lead to satiety and habituation which may show up as subconscious irritation out of sync libidos performance demands and insecurities And it may promote the use of risky sexual enhancement measures as lovers try to overcome their built in biological brakes with force Not to be alarmist but Viagra for example has been associated with sudden irreversible blindness and has been blamed for many deaths through heart attack and stroke Perhaps we are pressuring ourselves to reach unrealistic benchmarks Meanwhile gentle relaxed intercourse without orgasm is off limits for Catholics and dysfunctional for the rest of us As a consequence if couples don t know about or have fallen out of the habit of using other daily bonding behaviors to sustain the sparkle in their relationship they are quite likely to rely only on sex with attempted orgasm s to keep their union strong What would bonobo life look like if one of the chimps favorite social bonding techniques rubbing genitals had to result in mutual climax or produce disappointment and resentment I think zoologists would see a lot of cranky chimps A more relaxed approach to sex may prove especially beneficial for pair bonders like us Our nervous system appears to reward us for both close trusted companionship and the exchange of selfless affection In other pair bonding species sexual behavior is neither especially frequent nor especially fervent Many interactions between mates take the form of resting together mutual grooming and hanging out The Myth of Monogamy Maybe our limitations exist to urge us toward less driven affection Perhaps it s time to expand our lovemaking repertoire to include relaxed non goal oriented sexual activity with the primary goals of closer bonds and increased contentment intercourse, vs., orgasm, living where did humans get the idea that sex must alwayslead to orgasm?,url:huffingtonpost marnia robinson intercourse vs orgasm_b_313316 html}',\n",

Tasty Kitchen Featured Saturday morning note I m bumping this recipe up to the top again because it wound up being my favorite from last week Yum Okay fine Taken from start to finish this took a little longer than sixteen minutes But it did take sixteen minutes to get it to the point where it simmers in the skillet so it sorta kinda maybe possibly counts What can I say I like consistency I couldn t bear the thought of breaking the run of 16 Minute titles this week Boy oh boy was this one good Scrumptious moist meatballs simmered in marinara sauce then spooned into a standard dinner roll and surrounded by melted cheese It s a slider of sorts only it s a meatball sandwich instead of a burger I got the big thumbs up from the three men in my house They absolutely loved them I took a slightly Italian approach for these with the marinara sauce and the provolone cheese But I came very close to using my comfort food meatball recipe here on my site and in my cookbook for those of you who have it It s made with more of a ketchup base and winds up tasting more like meatloaf Either approach works Here s how I made these Start with ground chuck or regular ground beef Throw a pound or so into a mixing bowl Throw in some unseasoned bread crumbs These are panko but you can use whatever you have on hand You can also soak a couple of slices of sandwich bread in 1 2 cup of milk and add that instead Lots of options Mince a clove of garlic and add that in Then add plenty of salt and pepper Next pour in a little milk Obviously you won t want to do this if you ve gone with the bread soaked in milk method Now knead the mixture all together until it s totally combined Scoop out about a tablespoon of the mixture Then roll them into neat balls Meanwhile heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat Dice half of a small onion and throw it into the oil After a minute or so place the meatballs in between the onions so that they re right up against the skillet You might have to do two batches depending on the size of your skillet Cook them for a minute or two until they start to get brown Then pour in a whole jar of marinara sauce You can certainly make your own or you can just pour in plain tomato sauce and season it however you d like But for this dish jarred marinara really does work well Shake the pan around a bit it s hard to stir without disturbing the meat a balls then put the lid on and simmer the meatballs for a good 20 minutes shaking the pan occasionally to prevent burning Mmmm Smells so good When the meatballs are done grab some dinner rolls Marlboro Man picked these up for me on his way back through town yesterday because I don t like to leave my house and Marlboro Man likes to enable me They re just standard soft dinner rolls but potato rolls would be fine too Sliders are so popular now some supermarkets probably have specialty slider rolls I wouldn t know this though since I have no supermarkets in my life It s just a guess Next grab some thinly sliced Provolone Cut the stack into four equal wedges Grab however many rolls you need Slice them in half And place a slice of cheese both on the top and bottom of each roll Spoon a meat ball and a good amount of sauce on each roll Top it off then throw em on a plate and serve em The cheese will melt and all will be wonderful in the universe and in your house Yum Serve with a big green salad carrot sticks and a glass of milk Your boys and okay your girls though they might not want to admit it will love em Oh I almost forgot you ll love em too Love Pioneer Woman Prep Time 16 Minutes

       "  u'{title:German Sausage Peppers Crepes of Wrath ,body:I had Monday off for President s Day it was a lovely much needed mini break from the world Kramer and I tried to make the most of our extra day we ate some great tacos at our favorite Mexican place La Superior on Friday then just hung out at home and installed some light fixtures kitchen on Saturday On Sunday we met up with our friend Eric and he took us out to Sheepshead Bay for some traditional Uzbeki food at Nargis Cafe It was delicious and unbelievably cheap We had so much food that we could barely finish everything on the table but we mostly managed It was definitely worth the train ride out there and I honestly can t wait to go back or to go try more places like it It was fun to get out of the city for a while too On Monday we made a big breakfast at our place hung up some posters that we got framed such as this awesome Star Wars set I only have a low quality photo of them for now and watched Exit Through the Gift Shop which was completely different than I expected it to be I was really surprised how much I liked it and how wrong I was to initially think it was going to be just about how cool Banksy is If you get a chance definitely check it out It s nominated for Best Documentary at the Oscars this year and with good reason This is one of the first meals that I made in our new apartment and I had to break in the new Staub pots that my Aunt Donna was generous enough to give to Kramer and I for our housewarming gift Aren t they adorable I absolutely love them I had recently picked up some bratwursts and after watching an episode of this most recent season of Top Chef I was inspired by a take on sausage and peppers that Mike Isabella made for Jimmy Fallon s birthday It just looked like good classic comfort food and Kramer and I were looking for that after spending all day moving and re arranging our new place I cooked it all in a cast iron skillet for a good crispiness on the outside of the brats while still being able to caramelize the vegetables I used shallots instead of onions but onions would work well here too I also used mini sweet bell peppers that I had which were very good but again regular bell peppers work well too I made sure to use a bit of German beer to cook the shallots in for some depth of flavor some mushrooms because I had them and I would put mushrooms in almost everything if I could then finished cooking the brats in with the vegetables so that they would release their juices and develop a nice sauce for a richer taste You can eat these on a roll as a sandwich or in a bowl on its own it is a really flavorful hearty meal that can be put together fairly quickly and is sure to please all types of palates The ingredients Melt a tablespoon of butter in your pan over medium high heat When the butter is foaming add in the brats Cook for 2 3 minutes on each side until they are nice and browned on both sides When they re ready take them out of the pan and place them on a separate plate You don t want them to be fully cooked just yet so just let them sit for now Reduce the heat to medium low and deglaze your pan with 1 2 cup of beer making sure to scrape up all the browned bits Add in your thinly sliced shallots and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes Add in your thinly sliced bell peppers and cook everything for another 8 minutes or so until caramelized Add in the garlic when you re ready I like my garlic thinly sliced but you can mince it too if you like Cook for a minute or two until fragrant Place everything in a bowl and set aside Wipe out the pan with a paper towel as best you can and reduce your heat to medium low When you wash mushrooms you generally just want to clean them with a damp cloth instead of running them under water When you run them under water it takes away a lot of their delicate flavor Slice the mushrooms thinly And add them to the dry pan Mushrooms release a lot of liquid as they are cooked so when you first put them in a hot pan you don t want to have added any oil or butter just yet Let them brown for 2 3 minutes first You will notice how nicely they cook all on their own After they have browned you can add a tablespoon of butter to them and cook for another minute or two until some of the butter has been absorbed by the mushrooms Add the pepper mixture back to the pan with the mushrooms Thinly slice your brats and add them to the pan Cook over medium heat until the brats have cooked through and season with salt pepper and or red pepper flakes German Sausage PeppersPrint this recipe Total Cooking Time 35 45 minutesYield 4 5 servings 2 tablespoons unsalted butter5 bratwursts1 2 cup German beer2 shallots thinly sliced5 small sweet bell peppers or 2 regular bell peppers thinly sliced5 cloves garlic very thinly sliced1 pint mushrooms thinly sliced1 8 teaspoon kosher salt1 4 teaspoon ground black pepper1 4 teaspoon red pepper flakes optional fresh basil sliced thinly for garnish 4 rolls for serving optional 1 Heat 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter in a large skillet or cast iron pan over medium high heat When the butter is foaming add in the bratwursts and cook for 2 3 minutes on each side until nicely browned Do not cook them completely through you want them to cook more later along with the shallots and peppers Remove the brats from the pan and set aside on a separate plate 2 Reduce the heat to medium and deglaze the pan with the beer make sure you scrape up all the good browned bits with a wooden spoon Add a splash or two more if you are so inclined Add in the thinly sliced shallots saute for about 5 minutes then add in the thinly sliced bell peppers Continue to saute until caramelized about 8 more minutes over medium heat Add in the garlic and cook for 1 2 minutes until fragrant Remove the mixture from the pan place it in a separate bowl and wipe down the pan with a paper towel 3 Add the thinly sliced mushrooms to the dry skillet Mushrooms release their own juices as they cook so they should not be cooked in butter and or oil from the start Make sure that the mushrooms aren t too crowded in the pan either cook them in batches if need be The mushrooms will begin to brown and soften after a few minutes over medium heat When they ve started to brown add in the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter and gently saute When the mushrooms have absorbed some of the butter and are nice and golden add the shallots peppers and garlic back to the pan Stir to combine 4 Thinly slice the brats that you have set aside and add them to the pan They should still be a bit pink in the middle when you add them to the pan but as they cook they will release their juices and really develop the flavor of the whole dish Cook over medium heat until the brats are cooked through Taste and add more salt and or pepper if you like along with the red pepper flakes Sprinkle with a bit of fresh basil Serve in bowls or as a sandwich Tagged as alcohol beer

       "  u\"{url:huffingtonpost 2013 05 28 napping tips expert strat n 3320571,title:7 Expert Strategies For Maximizing Your Naptime how to nap like a pro,body:If you re dragging this first day back to work after the holiday weekend think again before heading for the coffee machine Taking a short mid day snooze could actually be a more effective way to give yourself a mental boost Naps have been shown to counter the effects of sleep deprivation boost energy and productivity and improve cognitive functioning among other health benefits But not all naps are created equal Taking a snooze at specific times of the day and for only certain lengths of time can help you to optimize your naptime and ensure that you wake up feeling rested and refreshed We enlisted the help of sleep expert Michael Breus Ph D for his best tips on successful napping Scroll through the list below for seven essential rules 1 Avoid Naps If You re An Insomniac If you re sleep deprived then you stand to benefit greatly from a short daytime snooze as a supplement to your regular nighttime sleep But if you suffer from insomnia meaning you have trouble falling asleep staying asleep or both at night naps could make it even harder to fall asleep at night Research has found that avoiding naps can actually improve sleep continuity for insomniacs If you ve got insomnia you don t want to be a napper because there s data that shows that the last time you were asleep will directly affect how long it takes you to fall asleep Breus says So if you re asleep taking a nap at 2 p m it s going to take you much longer period of time to fall asleep 2 Give Yourself A 30 Minute Limit Short naps should generally last around 25 30 minutes says Breus That amount of time allows you to rest without the risk of entering into deep sleep and waking up feeling even more tired The 30 minute nap is particularly important for people who are tired during the day and didn t sleep enough that night and want to supplement their sleep a little bit says Breus If you take it longer than 30 minutes you end up in deep sleep Have you ever taken a nap and felt worse when you woke up That s what s happening you re sleeping too long and you re going into a stage of sleep that s very difficult to get out of 3 Try For A Full Sleep Cycle Nap If You Have Time If you re feeling particularly tired and have time for a 90 minute nap your body will thank you for it This amount of shuteye will allow your body to go into REM sleep which can begin to make up for lost sleep and maybe even enhance creativity The average person s sleep cycle is about 90 minutes so you either want to take a 25 30 minute nap or you want to take a 90 minute nap depending upon how much time you have and how you want to feel when you wake up says Breus 4 Try A Caffeine Nap Breus recommends trying a short caffeine nap or as he calls it a napalatte that can leave you feeling extra energized afterwards Quickly drink a cup of coffee slightly cooled of course and take a 20 minute nap immediately afterwards The caffeine will kick in right after you wake up leaving you feeling mentally sharp and refreshed You re good for four hours guaranteed says Breus 5 Try A Walk Outside Instead Of A Nap After Lunch When patients complain of lagging energy after lunch Breus often recommends taking a walk outside in the sunshine for 15 minutes instead of lying down If you re tired because of stress or a hectic schedule spending a little time outdoors may be a more effective energy booster If you re normally getting tired between one and three in the afternoon which most people do that doesn t necessarily mean you need a nap Breus explains It might mean that you need sunlight Your core body temperature drops at this time of the afternoon and that s a signal to your brain to produce sleep chemical melatonin so going in the sunlight where melatonin can t be produced may help 6 Don t Nap After 4 P M If your tiredness is the result of sleep deprivation taking a short nap in the middle of the afternoon can give your energy levels a boost You re most likely to fall asleep is between noon and 4 p m which matches the low point of the body s circadian cycle If you re going to nap at work Breus advises bringing a napping kit with an eye mask ear plugs and a mini alarm clock to improve your chances of falling asleep 7 Even A 10 Minute Rest Can Help We do see value in those kind of naps absolutely says Breus of the super short nap Even if you don t fall completely asleep a five or 10 minute power nap can still be beneficial if you re feeling sleep deprived A 2002 study found that snoozing for just 10 minutes can result in greater feelings of alertness after a night of restricted sleep Tell us How do you optimize your naps Share your thoughts in the comments or tweet HealthyLiving Earlier on HuffPost napping, tips:, 7, expert, strategies, for, maximizing, your, naptime, healthy, living if you're

       "  u'{title:Bacon Explosion The BBQ Sausage Recipe of all Recipes BBQ Addicts ,body:The other day the guys from BaconToday com contacted me in search for some barbecue bacon recipes Of course I have plenty of great uses for bacon in a barbecue pit but the longer I thought about it the more I wanted to step it up a notch and clog a few arteries for those guys Behold BACON EXPLOSION Here s what you ll need 2 pounds thick cut bacon2 pounds Italian sausage1 jar of your favorite barbeque sauce1 jar of your favorite barbeque rub To kick off the construction of this pork medley you ll need to create a 5 5 bacon weave If the strips you re using aren t as wide as the ones pictured then you may need to use a few extra slices to fill out the pattern Just make sure your bacon weave is tight and that you end up with a nice square shape to work with The next step is to add some barbecue seasoning on top of your bacon weave Being the barbeque addict that I am I whipped up a batch of Burnt Finger BBQ s competition pork rub for this special occasion Seeing as not everyone has the time or the expertise to create a tasty rub of their own I would recommend trying Cowtown Sweet Spot for the best combination Plowboys Yardbird Bad Byron s Butt Rub and Rendezvous Famous Seasoning are also excellent choices Now that you re pork is well seasoned it s time to add more pork Take two pounds of Italian sausage and layer it directly on top of your bacon weave Be sure to press the sausage to the outer edges of the bacon creating a patty that is the same thickness all the way across Most grocery stores carry loose sausage so just pick out one you like I chose to go with a mild sausage but spicy would work just the same If you really want to get crazy take a stab at making your own homemade sausage Next up is bacon layer number two Take the remaining bacon slices and fry them up the same way you would for breakfast or lunch or dinner or a midnight snack If you like soft bacon make it soft If you like crunchy bacon make it crunchy If you like your bacon burnt to hell so the smoke detectors go off then burn it to hell so the smoke detectors go off These pieces are going to be a major part of the inner flavor of our sausage fatty so cook them your favorite way Personally I like my bacon right at the point when it starts to get crispy but hasn t quite lost all of the softness yet Regardless of how well done you like yours you ll need to crumble or chop the cooked strips into bite size pieces and place on top of the sausage layer Note It s okay and encouraged to snack on these pieces while your chopping crumbling But keep in mind that once those bacon morsels touch the raw sausage you ll need to resist all temptations to nibble This can and will be difficult but hospital trips are no fun so stay strong Since this is a barbeque recipe we need to add another layer of barbeque flavor Take your favorite sauce and drizzle it all over the top of the bacon pieces Personally I prefer to use Burnt Finger BBQ s homemade competition sauce but if you re torn on what brand to use I recommend Cowtown Blues Hog and Fiorella s Jack Stack Once you ve sauced the bacon sprinkle on some more of the barbeque seasoning you used on the bacon weave Now comes the fun part Very carefully separate the front edge of the sausage layer from the bacon weave and begin rolling backwards You want to include all layers EXCEPT the bacon weave in your roll Try and keep the sausage as tight as possible and be sure to release any air pockets that may have formed Once the sausage is fully rolled up pinch together the seams and ends to seal all of the bacon goodness inside At this point we can start to see the final shape of our Bacon Explosion but we re missing one key item To complte the constuction process roll the sausage forward completely wrapping it in the bacon weave Make sure it sits with the seam facing downward to help keep it all sealed up Sprinkle some barbeque seasoning on the outside of the bacon weave and now this bad boy is ready for the smoker Cook your Bacon Explosion at 225 degrees in a constant cloud of hickory smoke until your Thermapen gives an internal temperature reading of 165 degrees Normally this will take about 1 hour for each inch of thickness but that could vary depending on how well you maintain your fire and also how many times you open the smoker to take a peek Mine took about 2 5 hours which was right on target with its 2 5 inch diameter Now that our Bacon Explosion is fully cooked we need to add some finishing flavors Remember that barbecue sauce we used for inner flavor We ll be using that same sauce to glaze the cooked bacon weave Using a basting brush coat the entire surface with a thin layer of sauce Sweet sauces are loaded with sugars so they ll give your fatty a nice glossy finish Spicy and vinegar based sauces don t contain as much so they won t set up as well If you re dead set on using those sauces just cut them with a bit of honey and you ll get the same effect Slice the Bacon Explosion into quarter to half inch rounds to serve If your roll was good and tight you should now see a nice bacon pinwheel pattern throughout the sausage Obviously pork is best served by itself but if you feel the need to make this meat monster into a sandwich try placing a couple Bacon Explosion slices on a warm Pillsbury s Grands Biscuit You ll reach pork Nirvana in no time flat Be sure to send us stories and photos of your Bacon Explosion experience Who knows you may see your ugly mug on BBQ Addicts

my daily staples as they re packed full of fiber and the healthy fats that will keep your skin smooth and youthful As an added bonus avocados are full of fiber and are associated with helping to lower cholesterol Try them sliced up with some tomato slices or added into a salad 19 Raw granola Feeling hungry mid day Raw granola may just be your new best friend Look for granola mixes that aren t overly processed raw granola is best if you can find it that are gluten free and that aren t packed with extra sugar If you can t find a suitable commercial brand consider making your own raw granola

mucus and eliminate toxins from our systems For the biggest energy boost check your local health food store for brands without any extra sugar or preservatives As a side note dried figs are naturally

       "  u'{title:Tuesdays with Dorie Burnt Sugar Ice Cream ,body:Look out bikini Your wearer has discovered a way to make ice cream without an actual ice cream maker And I thought that this would be one vice I d never have to worry about falling for The secret is out now and there s no turning back Ignoring this tidbit of knowledge would be futile I would have better luck at stuffing Niles my 23lb Maine Coon into a clutch purse see sidebar for proof It s out it s loud and it s not about to be shoved into the corner I should be afraid very afraid But I m too busy being too excited to worry about the potentially dire consequences He s quite the wiley character that ice cream I don t know if it s the fact that this was my first homemade ice cream or if the recipe is just that amazing Maybe it s both This tasted better than my beloved H\\\\u00e4agen Dazs black walnut and Ben Jerry s classic vanilla As the name indicates you caramelize sugar until it turns a deep amber colour This gives it a sugary almost dulce de leche like flavour The next time I make it and there will be a next time I would omit the vanilla extract just so the caramel has a wide lead Making ice cream without a machine is quite easy albeit very time consuming But it s something I will force myself to do several times over the next few months Hopefully this wasn t just a case of beginners luck I ll be sure to keep my blog updated on this pressing news flash Update I made this again and took the caramel to the dark side Don t be afraid to cook the sugar it really has to be a deep amber The results were even better Thank you Becky for choosing this as your Tuesdays with Dorie recipe And thanks also to Alvarosa for providing the link to the David Lebovitz post on making ice cream from scratch Please visit Becky s blog Project Domestication for the standard Burnt Sugar Ice Cream recipe I have the instructions for those of us not blessed with an ice cream maker Just don t get too carried away For more eye candy please visit the other TWD bakers Burnt Sugar Ice Cream from Baking From My Home To Yours by Dorie Greenspan Ingredients1 cup sugar3 tbsp water2 cups whole milk1 cup heavy cream4 large egg yolkspinch of salt1 1 2 tsp pure vanilla extractStir the sugar and water together in a medium heavy bottomed saucepan Place the pan over medium low heat and cook until the sugar dissolves Increase the heat and boil without stirring until the syrup turns a deep amber color watch it carefully too dark and it will be too bitter from time to time brush down the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush and swirl the pan Depending on the size of your pan and the intensity of the heat it could take about 8 minutes for the caramel to color properly Stand back things can get a little wild lower the heat and add the milk and cream Don t be concerned when everything bubbles and seethes and the caramel hardens it will calm down and smooth out as you heat and stir Continue to heat and stir and when the mixture is smooth remove the pan from the heat In a medium heatproof bowl whisk the yolks and salt together until very well blended and just slightly thickened Still whisking drizzle in about one third of the hot liquid this will temper or warm the eggs so they don t curdle Whisking all the while slowly pour in the remaining liquid pour the custard back into the pan and cook over medium heat stirring without stopping until the custard slightly thickens and coats the back of a spoon if you run your finger down the bowl of the spoon the custard should not run into the track the custard should reach at least 170F but no more than 180F on an instant read thermometer Immediately remove the pan from the heat and pour the custard into a 2 quart glass measuring cup or clean heatproof bowl Stir in the vanilla extract David Lebovitz method for making ice cream without a machine1 1 Prepare your ice cream mixture then chill it over an ice bath 2 Put a deep baking dish or bowl made of plastic stainless steel or something durable in the freezer and pour your custard mixture into it 3 After forty five minutes open the door and check it As it starts to freeze near the edges remove it from the freezer and stir it vigorously with a spatula or whisk Really beat it up and break up any frozen sections Return to freezer 4 Continue to check the mixture every 30 minutes stirring vigorously as it s freezing If you have one you can use a hand held mixer for best results or use a stick blender or hand held mixer But since we re going low tech here you can also use just a spatula or a sturdy whisk along with some modest physical effort 5 Keep checking periodically and stirring while it freezes by hand or with the electric mixer until the ice cream is frozen It will likely take 2 3 hours to be ready It took mine about 5 hours to get to that perfect consistency But the bowl I was using was deep and narrow The process would be faster in a wide shallow bowl ,url:pixie baker

March 2012 Capsule Wardrobe See more information about this look Pajama tops are no longer just for bedtime But how to wear them when you re not climbing into bed Embrace their lounginess with an equally effortless silhouette pairing them with something drapey on the bottom Not a fan of skirts Pajama tops also look lovely paired with shorts for a big over small look 1 Start with a tank paired with a pleated skirt for a long lean look 2 Layer on your pajama top whose silhouette echoes the drape of the silky pleated skirt We love how the pajama top over the drapey skirt makes for an effortlessly lean look 3 Finish off the look with accessories in complementary colors a pair of amber glasses a brown resin necklace a moss and teal tote and a pair of sand leather sandals How will you wear a pajama top Share your style in the comments Posted by Trisha on March 16th 2012 in Ready Made Outfits Women We believe that every woman should have a tuxedo jacket in her closet It may not be as classic as the basic black or navy blazer but the tuxedo jacket instantly elevates a look and a white blazer pairs perfectly with spring florals and brights What we love about this particular jacket is the sleek silhouette with the crisp lapels it s definitely a woman s jacket even though it s borrowed from the boys Worth the investment 288 at Anthropologie Posted by Trisha on March 15th 2012 in Shopping Guide Women This look is part of Omiru s March 2012 Lookbook series which builds upon our 16 Piece March 2012 Capsule Wardrobe See more information about this look Color theory 101 says that opposite colors attract but it doesn t take theory to know that black effortlessly elevates a look We took a playful look based upon a purple and yellow color pairing and we instantly made it more glamourous with a few choice accessories in noir 1 Start building the look with a pair of colors opposite each other on the color wheel a bright yellow pair of denim pants paired with a lilac purple oxford shirt 2 Colorblocking is especially lovely when done subtly so slip on a grey cropped sweater the echoed colorblocking at the hem an extra plus That way your lilac purple collar will pop out from the grey sweater giving the look just a touch of purple 3 Finish off the look with three key accessories in black a statement necklace with a ribbon tie to echo the closure on the sweater a structured shopper bag and a pair of colorblocked ankle booties How will you wear black accessories Share your style in the comments Posted by Trisha on March 14th 2012 in Ready Made Outfits Women Bold colors and Aztec prints you get two trends for the price of one with this stunning scarf With warm reds and browns and cool blues this scarf would look lovely paired with either warm or cool colors making it the perfect pick me up to any daytime outfit from a simple tee and jeans to a spring dress 29 90 at Zara Posted by Trisha on March 13th 2012 in Shopping Guide Women This look is part of Omiru s March 2012 Lookbook series which builds upon our 16 Piece March 2012 Capsule Wardrobe See more information about this look Refresh your spring wardrobe with a look inspired by the sea For most of us it s still far too early to hit the beach but that doesn t mean that we can t capture the joie de vivre of a trip to the seaside in a crisply casual urban look 1 Start your fantasy journey to the sea with a gorgeous tie neck blouse paired over a seafoam skinny jean Let the blouse float over your jeans for a laid back look 2 Bundle up with a navy sweater layered under a royal blue long blazer 3 Accessorize in natural colors greens turquoises and browns We loved the look of this aqua bowler with the blues of the outfit If you want to layer on the jewelry try a geometric colorblocked cuff No necklaces please as jewelry would visually compete with the tie neckline on the blouse 4 Slip on a pair of aqua accented heels for a going out look or try an espadrille for a more casual look How will you wear blue Share your style in the comments Posted by Trisha on March 12th 2012 in Ready Made Outfits Women You can t ever have enough simple camis and this is one that we ll be wearing with denim cutoffs and gladiator sandals come summer What we love about this extra long cami is threefold 1 Its shape is extremely flattering and works with not against your personal architecture 2 The cami is long enough to be a dress when temperatures warm up that is 3 The mesh cross while noticeable in the image is much more subtle in real life So you get a bit of detail without it making too much of a statement 44 at Topshop Posted by Trisha on March 9th 2012 in Shopping Guide Women This look is part of Omiru s March 2012 Lookbook series which builds upon our 16 Piece March 2012 Capsule Wardrobe See more information about this look What can we say we love the color red It s the color of love apropos no of power of passion It s stunning in small doses but we re not afraid to punch up a look by anchoring it in red The trick to wearing such a strong color is to center your outfit with it but then echo the color in small doses elsewhere in the look 1 Start with the most basic of foundations a white blouse over a pair of jeans Of course our white blouse and jeans each have a twist The white blouse features a beautiful tie neck detail and the jeans are constructed of a deep brown fabric with a shine coating 2 Anchor the look with your signature piece a cropped red jacket featuring shades of blue and grey for contrast 3 The red doesn t stop there Echo the red in your shoes note the blood red stacked heel and your sunglasses classic Wayfarers get a punchy update But keep your handbag neutral red here would look a little too matchy matchy How will you wear red Share your style in the comments Posted by Trisha on March 8th 2012 in Ready Made Outfits Women This season it s all about the collar Detachable collars metal tipped collars contrast collars and DIY collars But the emphasis on the collarbone doesn t need to stop there we re loving choker necklaces to keep the focus near your face Sleek and sensual this silver choker necklace not so subtly draws attention to your face and your d\\\\u00e9colletage Wear it with simple silhouettes in solid colors for best effect don t make it compete with loud patterns and textures 56 at Bauble Bar Posted by Trisha on March 7th 2012 in Shopping Guide Women This look is part of Omiru s March 2012 Lookbook series which builds upon our 16 Piece March 2012 Capsule Wardrobe See more information about this look How many colors can you wear without looking color schizophrenic We managed to work with nine black red royal blue mustard white orange teal and purple in a single look that is cohesive in its singular focus on color This study in color is accented by the schoolgirl pleated skirt and the geek chic glasses but this look will take you anywhere but the library 1 Start with a colorful striped sweater paired with a pleated skirt Notice how the brights in sweater are made even more vibrant by the springy green skirt 2 Royal blue heels provide a solid foundation for the look and pick up on the blue in the sweater 3 Add a bit more color with your handbag a colorblocked purse in orange purple and teal extends the look even further on the color wheel PS Geek chic classes optional but we love the look How will you wear color Share your style in the comments Posted by Trisha on March 6th 2012 in Ready Made Outfits Women With this stunning pair of earrings from A Peace Treaty you can do good while looking good We re loving this pair of handmade earrings for their fierce beauty the delicate dangling goldplated brass chains are tipped by spikes for a look that s both hard and soft What s special about A Peace Treaty Each season the designers travel to a region to seek out local village artisans to create unique limited edition accessories Not only does A Peace Treaty support the local craftspeople with employment opportunities but they also donate to international aid organizations to support reconstruction efforts in areas of socio political strife 150 at A Peace Treaty Posted by

       "  u'{title:Lemon Poppy Seed Scones Recipe Oh Nuts Blog ,body:There are breakfast foods and then there are breakfast foods Breakfast foods are quick easy and uninspired They can be thrown together and eaten in a few minutes before rushing off to work or a full day of errands They satisfy hunger but are rarely satisfying Breakfast foods on the other hand are lots of fun They re for special occasions and weekend brunches and birthday mornings They re what you order when you go out to eat They make ordinary days seem a little special Care to guess which category of breakfast foods these lemon poppy seed scones fall into These scones are my ideal breakfast food They re indulgent but not too heavy They re sweet but not cloying so I can eat several of them and not regret it They take a little time but aren t too complicated or fussy And the lemon and poppy seed flavors pair perfectly with a dollop of jam a side of fresh fruit and your morning beverage of choice Lemon Poppy Seed Scones Recipeyield 8 large or 12 medium scones3 1 3 cups flour 2 cups powdered sugar 3 4 tsp baking powder 1 4 tsp baking soda 1 8 tsp salt 2 tbsp 1 tsp poppy seedsZest of 2 large lemons 5 ounces cold butter cubed 1 cup cold heavy cream For the glaze Juice of 1 lemon 1 cup powdered sugar sifted2 3 tsp milk Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit Start by zesting the large lemons Use a microplane if you have it otherwise use a grater with the smallest holes you can find and chop the zest up finely with a sharp knife In the bowl of a large stand mixer combine the flour powdered sugar baking powder baking soda and salt Turn the mixer on low speed and run it for 20 30 seconds until the dry ingredients are well mixed Add the lemon zest and poppy seeds and mix everything again on low speed for about 10 seconds until the zest and seeds disappear into the flour Add the cold butter cubes to the dry ingredients and mix on low speed Stay by the mixer and watch it carefully as you don t want to over mix at this stage Mix everything together until the mixture is crumbly and you have butter pieces ranging from the size of oatmeal flakes to the size of peas Stop mixing when you still have chunks of butter this will make your scones flaky and tender Now with the mixer running on low stream in the cold heavy cream and mix just until it s almost incorporated Stop the mixer when you still have some streaks of flour and stir the last of the flour in by hand with a spatula making sure to scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl Turn the scone dough out onto a floured work surface and knead it together gently Don t work it too much or the scones will be tough Press the dough into a circle about 3 4 inch thick If you have the time chill the dough for 30 minutes This step can be omitted but it improves the taste and texture of the scones if you can manage to plan far enough in advance Use a large sharp knife to cut the scones into wedges This recipe will yield eight very large scones or twelve medium sized scones Brush the tops of the scones with a little cream or milk then sprinkle them with a generous dusting of granulated sugar Bake the scones in the preheated 375 F oven for 22 25 minutes until they are puffed with a crackly top and golden brown edges Let the scones cool completely then make the glaze Sift the powdered sugar into a medium bowl and squeeze the juice from one lemon over the sugar Stir the sugar and juice together The mixture will be very difficult to stir at first but as you continue to stir it should turn into a thick liquid Add 2 teaspoons of milk and check the texture it should drip in a thick ribbon from a spoon and hold its shape for a few seconds before running together If it s too thick add another spoonful of milk but resist the temptation to add lots of extra liquid if it s too thin the glaze will run everywhere once you drizzle it on the scones Dip a spoon in the glaze and drizzle the glaze over the scones in a criss cross pattern Let them sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes to set the glaze before serving the scones Enjoy these lemon poppy seed scones with a pat of butter a little whipped cream or your favorite jam or jelly They re best the day they re made but if you wrap them well they can be stored for several days at room temperature All text and images c Elizabeth LaBau ,url:ohnuts blog 2012 05 lemon poppy seed scones recipe 1 html}',\n",

       "  u'{title:Milk Chocolate Oreo Chunk Cookies the chocolate peanut butter gallery ,body:The idea for these cookies came from the blog Cookie Madness I just kind of glanced at the photo and recipe and instantly decided to make them before really reading the post and recipe When I saw that it was made with Martha Stewart s Milk Chocolate Cookie recipe I was a little disappointed Martha s recipe is amazingly good if you are eating the cookies hot straight out of the oven But they don t keep well at all and as a grazer as opposed to a binger I like my cookies to last a few days So I decided to use my old stand by recipe for Fudge Cookies which is from page 48 of Mrs Fields Best Ever Cookie Book I simply added 8 5 oz of chopped milk chocolate and 11 chopped double stuffed oreos They are soft and delicious and at the least you can at least get 3 days out of them So why am I posting this recipe when it appears to lack peanut butter Because it would be very easy to use chopped Peanut Butter Oreos instead or peanut butter chips instead of milk chocolate chunks They d be quite delicious that way so I highly recommend you try it And by the way the key to making a cookie like this that has so much chocolate is to use the highest quality chocolate you can afford I used Askinosie Cocoa Powder and Ghiradelli Semisweet Chips for the dough and Fat Pig Milk Chocolate for the chunks Don t you wish you could take a bite Recipe after the break Chocolate CookieYields about 42 cookiesAdapted from Mrs Fields Best Ever Cookie Book Ingredients12 oz semisweet chocolate finely chopped2 cups all purpose flour3 4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder1 tsp baking soda1 4 tsp salt2 stick 1 cup unsalted butter softened1 1 2 cups packed brown sugar3 large eggs at room temperature2 tsp vanilla extract9 oz milk chocolate chunks11 double stuffed oreos quartered Directions 1 Preheat oven to 300 and prepare baking sheets with parchment paper 2 In a double boiler melt the semisweet chocolate over hot not simmering water Set aside to cool slightly In a medium bowl combine the flour cocoa baking soda and salt 3 In a large bowl with an electric mixer cream the butter and sugar Beat in eggs and vanilla until just combined Blend in the cooled semisweet chocolate Blend in the flour mixture until just combined Mix in the chopped milk chocolate and oreos 4 Drop the dough by rounded tablespoons 2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheets Bake for 18 to 22 minutes mine were ready in 18 exactly or until just set Cool on the cookie sheet for one minute then transfer to racks to cool completely ,url:cpbgallery 2008 09 11 milk chocolate oreo chunk cookies}',\n",

       "  u'{title:Healthy Eating The basics of healthy eating ,body:Overview Date updated February 06 2009 Debby Golonka MPH Content provided by Healthwise How can I start eating healthier Healthy eating means choosing a variety of foods from the basic food groups meat and meat substitutes dairy fruits and vegetables grains such as breads and pasta and a limited amount of fats and sweets As simple as this sounds it s not always easy to get the nutrition you need You may eat more of your favorite foods from only one food group and as a result get less of other food groups Or perhaps you opt for convenience over quality when you are hungry Healthy eating requires some planning and purpose and an effort to include a variety of foods in your meals If you look closely at how you eat you might find you aren t getting enough nutrients because you don t get the recommended number of servings from each food group So not only is it important to pay attention to what you eat but also to what food groups you may not eat enough of To accomplish this keep a food diary of everything you eat and drink for 1 week Pay attention to serving sizes and check to see if you are eating a variety of foods from each of the food groups You don t need to meet the minimum number every day but try to get the recommended intake on average over a week If you are not getting the recommended amount of servings from each food group you may be missing important nutrients For example if you rarely eat fruits or vegetables you may not get enough vitamin C beta carotene or potassium Making a few small changes can help ensure that you re eating a variety of healthy foods Do I have to make dramatic changes in how I eat After you are aware of food groups that you may be missing or other ways that your eating is out of balance you can begin to make a few small changes toward healthier eating habits For example simply adding a yogurt as a snack might be enough to meet your milk servings Adding a sliced banana to your cereal will take care of a fruit serving Paying attention to serving sizes is also important You may not know that a serving size of cereal is only 1 oz 28 g which is \\\\u00bd to 1 cup for most cereals That means a typical bowl full of cereal is usually far more than a serving So instead of a big bowl of cereal and milk for breakfast have one or two servings 1 to 2 oz of cereal with a sliced banana and have a small glass 1 cup of juice Try low fat or nonfat milk or soy milk instead of whole milk on your cereal to reduce the amount of fat you take in If you find that you rarely eat fruits or vegetables make it a goal to include a serving or two at each meal Only \\\\u00bd cup of a cooked vegetable or 1 cup of salad greens counts as one serving Drinking a small can of tomato juice adding lettuce to your sandwich putting tomato sauce on your pasta these are all ways to boost your vegetable servings As you make changes continue with your food diary Set a weekly goal as you add or change what you are eating For example this week make it your goal to order a salad instead of french fries add vegetables to your pizza or bring a yogurt to work every day Just remember food is one of life s greatest pleasures All foods if eaten in moderation can be a part of healthy eating If your favorite foods are high in fat salt sugar and calories limit how often you eat them eat smaller servings or look for healthy substitutes Your key to healthy balanced eating is moderation Eat a wide variety of foods especially those high in nutrients such as whole grains fruits vegetables low fat dairy products lean meats fish poultry cooked dry beans nuts and seeds Can eating healthier protect me from diseases Healthy eating can actually help you lower your risk for disease To prevent disease the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend eating lots of fruits vegetables whole grains and low fat or nonfat dairy products The guidelines also emphasize balancing the food you eat with your activity to maintain your weight drinking alcohol in moderation no more than 2 drinks a day for men and 1 drink a day for women and limiting foods high in salt saturated fat trans fat cholesterol and added sugar Do I need to follow a low salt low carbohydrate or low fat diet Everyone can benefit from eating healthy foods but not everyone has the same nutritional needs Pregnant women growing children and older adults will have different needs for certain nutrients People who have high blood pressure need to watch how much salt they eat Those who have high cholesterol may be on a cholesterol lowering diet that restricts saturated and trans fats and cholesterol And people who have diabetes will need to spread the carbohydrate that they eat throughout the day If you are generally healthy and don t have health issues that require a special diet it s still wise to watch how much salt fat and added sugar you eat in order to prevent diseases such as heart disease and high blood pressure Limit the amount of salt you get by eating as many fresh foods as possible Processed foods fast food and restaurant foods are the major sources of dietary sodium Prepared foods such as soups snack foods and canned foods are also extremely high in salt Also watch the amount of fat you eat Replace saturated and trans fats with monounsaturated fats such as olive oil and canola oil Include healthy omega 3 fatty acids found in fish walnuts flaxseed and canola oil Low carbohydrate diets may help some people lose weight initially but they may not be healthy over a long period of time Low carb diets are high in total fat and saturated fat and are low in fiber They also restrict grains fruits and vegetables which protect against disease and provide important nutrients The 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans list fruits vegetables whole grains and low fat milk products as food groups to choose from for the greatest benefit Does eating healthier mean I have to go on a diet Eating healthier does not mean that you need to go on a restrictive diet Eating healthier means making changes that you can stay with over time Consistently eating foods that are low in saturated fats and trans fats and that include whole grains fruits vegetables and healthy fats such as olive oil will lower your risk for disease Being physically active along with healthy eating will improve your health even further Regular physical activity significantly reduces the risk of heart disease high blood pressure stroke type 2 diabetes obesity anxiety depression and

       "  u'{title:Italian Chicken Marsala Recipe A Food Centric Life ,body:When I want to serve a special chicken dish that I know everyone will love I make Chicken Marsala Richly flavored with a reduction of Marsala wine mushrooms and pancetta Chicken Marsala is a classic Italian dish It offers enough flair for entertaining and is easy enough for cooking during the week Start with golden chicken cutlets then make your sauce in the same pan Cook baby green beans in five minutes whip up a salad and make it a meal Slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally sprinkle with salt pepper and granulated garlic and dust with white whole wheat flour Follow directions for cooking chicken cutlets to a crisp golden brown then set them side It takes just a few minutes To do them all at once use a large 6 quart saute pan or a large skillet Notes on tools are at then end of the post In the same pan create a sauce with Marsala wine mushrooms pancetta garlic tomato paste and fresh oregano The flavors are irresistible A note on ingredients Marsala was originally named for where it was and still is produced the port city of Marsala on the Italian island of Sicily Marsala is a fortified wine which means spirits like brandy or alcohol have been added It was originally produced this way to preserve it for long ocean voyages hard to comprehend in the modern world of aviation and overnight shipping It s still produced the same way because of popularity My recipe was adapted from Cooks Illustrated I ve tried making it with both sweet and dry Marsala separately but find I prefer the flavor when I blend the sweet and dry together The Marsala I use is inexpensive and fortified wines last almost forever in a cool pantry If you are not familiar with pancetta it s Italian unsmoked bacon Find it in the deli section or at a deli counter The butcher can cut you a small chunk to dice up When I buy it this way I ll often eliminate some of the fat and use more of the meaty portion It s also available pre diced for quick use in many stores It regards to the fat content much of the fat is rendered out during cooking then drained off before being added back into the sauce Make it a Meal Add a green vegetable like baby green beans or tossed green salad for a side dish and maybe some whole wheat pasta tossed with olive oil and good Parmesan and you have a terrific dinner Crisp chicken breast cutlets topped with an Italian Marsala mushroom sauce Easy and elegant Serve with green beans or broccolini and whole wheat pasta tossed with olive oil and finely grated Parmesan cheese See this post for golden chicken cutlets for directions on how to cook the chicken It s easy and fast Adapted from Cooks Illustrated Serves 4 halves easily for 2 Ingredients For the Cutlets 1\\\\u00bd pounds 700 grams organic boneless skinless chicken breasts Salt pepper and granulated garlic as needed \\\\u00bd cup 75 grams white whole wheat or regular whole wheat flour 2 tablespoons 28 grams extra virgin olive oil For the Sauce 3 ounces 90 grams pancetta diced small 12 ounces 340 grams white or brown mushrooms sliced thin 2 large garlic cloves minced fine or pushed through a garlic press 1 tablespoon 15 grams tomato paste freeze extra for future use 8 ounces 237 ml dry Marsala wine 8 ounces 237 ml sweet Marsala wine 1 tablespoons fresh chopped oregano 1 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley optional for garnish 2 tablespoons 28 grams unsalted butter optional Fresh ground black pepper to taste Directions 1 Slice the chicken breasts in half and cook as described in the Golden Chicken Cutlets post It s easy and fast Set cutlets aside and keep them warm while you make the sauce 2 On a small plate fold up several layers of paper towels to drain the fat Over medium heat in the same pan cook the pancetta until crisp and golden Pour the pancetta onto the paper towels and drain off fat 3 In the same pan over medium heat add the sliced mushrooms It may seem dry at first but as the mushrooms cook and squeak they will give off their moisture You can add just a little olive oil if you want to maybe a teaspoon or two Cook the mushrooms until they give off their moisture and start to brown Add the garlic and tomato paste Cook 1 minute stirring Add both sweet and dry Marsala to the pan Cook until the wine is reduced and starting to get thick and syrupy Stir in the fresh oregano and you are ready to serve To serve place chicken cutlets on warm plates and top with the sauce Helpful links side dishes information and tools More about Marsala wine from Wikipedia Here s the recipe link for golden chicken cutlets Recipe for baby green beans You can serve them simply drizzled with a little olive oil salt and pepper Just cook according to the recipe 5 minutes and they are ready If you like Marsala you can make a classic Italian dessert called Zabaglione with it Recipe here rom Simply Recipes For pasta my favorite brand is Delallo Their whole wheat linguine and other cuts is terrific It s widely available in stores If you cook for a family All Clad makes a great big 14 skillet that holds a lot Here s the link at Sur La Table You can get all of your chicken done at once time It comes in a non stick version too Another big pan I could not live without is All Clad s 6 quart stainless steel saute The straight sides help prevent splattering and it comes with a lid The 3 quart saute is also pan I use constantly Better for smaller quantities and easier to store I buy the plain stainless steel Works great and is less expensive richly flavored with a reduction of marsala wine, mushrooms and pancetta, chicken marsala is a classic italian dish. enough flair for entertaining and is easy enough for cooking during the week. chicken, cutlet, breast,

Serious Eats ,body:Ramen Hacks 30 Easy Ways to Upgrade Your Instant Noodles Posted by J Kenji L\\\\u00f3pez Alt March 21 2011 at 6 00 PM Photographs J Kenji Lopez Alt Ramen in the U S has come a long way Once known only in its 10 for a dollar instant lunch form a staple of offices and dorm rooms all around the 80s and 90s high end real ramen shops are springing up left and right on both coasts and everywhere in between As a half Japanese kid in the 80s I grew up eating instant ramen at least once a week and it still holds a special place in my gut The real stuff is great but sometimes only the add hot water pack will do That said my tastes have changed and expanded considerably over the years and sometimes that little flavoring packet just isn t enough As such I ve spent a lot of time devising ways to upgrade my ramen in cheap easy ways Ghetto gourmet if you will As a card carrying member of the Ramen Transmogrification Society of Greater New York it is my duty my honor and my privilege to share with you some of our methods and recipes For full step by step instructions on any of these dishes please click through the slideshow above Our membership is pretty thin right now care to join Simple Add ins Mix ins The easiest way to quickly upgrade a bowl of instant noodles is with ingredients that require no extra cooking I m talking simple sauces and condiments like Miso paste Chili bean sauce Thai curry paste Japanese curry powder Fish sauce Harrisa Vinegar PonzuI m a condiment hoarder I ve got a whole double layered shelf of my fridge plus the entire door and a full pantry cabinet devoted to them so this is a particularly easy thing for me to do The key is not to go overboard with too many different competing flavors I often make this mistake after long nights out assuming that when it comes to hangover cures more is better Not the case Keep it simple Bear in mind that if you re using a salty condiment you should omit some of the seasoning packet You can also add Spices like white pepper sichuan pepper or chili flakes to the finished dish or try adding a cinnamon stick star anise and coriander seeds to the simmering broth remove em before serving Fats like toasted sesame oil chili oil or an animal fat pork chicken or duck are all awesome Citrus juices a quick squeeze of lemon or lime right before serving can go a long way to brightening flavors But imagine this scenario you re in college the power went out in your dorm room and you obviously had no choice but to finish all the beer in the fridge rather than let it warm up You re hungry but you can t use the water kettle Keanu Reeves pops up in your brain and asks What do you do What do you do Here s the answer Just crunch up the noodles in the bag tear off a corner add the seasoning packet hold the torn corner and shake it up then consume Lick your fingers clean after this one It s like eating Cheetos but with delicious Oriental flavor fingers instead of orange cheeze Vegetation Spinach Let s face it Ramen ain t health food But it s pretty simple to add a bit of roughage to your starch Quick cooking vegetables like baby spinach romaine lettuce bean sprouts thinly sliced cabbage watercress and scallions amongst others can be stirred into the soup right before serving They should wilt in a matter of seconds Longer cooking vegetables like broccoli cauliflower snap peas snow peas shredded carrots and whatever else your heart fancies can be added to the noodles as they re cooking It may take a bit of finagling to get the timing just right but I have faith in you young grasshopper Frozen vegetables can work great corn and peas in particular fare well frozen often being significantly better than their fresh counterparts I like to thaw them out by running them under hot water straight out of the tap for 30 seconds or so They can then be drained and added directly to the hot soup just before serving Eggs Boiled eggs Ramen are pretty much all starch and fat with most inexpensive ramen brands the noodles are dehydrated by deep frying them What about adding some extra protein Eggs are cheap delicious and in most cases can be cooked directly in the same pot with the noodles or the broth Here are a few simple ways to do it The World Society for Ramen Egg Cookery an organization which I founded chair and am the sole member of has divided ramen eggs into 5 levels It is unadvisable to attempt a higher level process until you ve completed each of the levels preceding it Level 1 Hard boiled eggs are the easiest just add the eggs to a pot of cold water bring it to a boil then drop in your noodles The egg should be pretty perfectly hard boiled in just about the same time that it takes to cook the ramen through Level 2 Soft boiled eggs are a tad trickier because they involve a time Drop them into the pot after it s come to a full boil start a timer and pull them out after 3 minutes for super soft or 5 for a fully set white and semi liquid yolk I like to cut the eggs open and stir the yolk into the broth as I eat it Level 3 The egg drop method creates small curds of egg blossoms that float in the broth and coat your noodles Lightly beat an egg in a small bowl Once your noodles are cooked swirl the noodles and hot broth gently around the pot While the broth is moving slowly drizzle in the beaten egg It should set into fine ribbons Level 4 Poached eggs will never come out perfectly shaped but who really cares Just cook the noodles until they ve just started to separate from each other about halfway through their total cooking time pull the pot off the heat break a raw egg into the center place the lid on the pot and let the whole thing sit for a couple minutes until both the noodles and eggs are cooked Level 5 Fried Eggs require the use of an auxiliary pan and heat source This is hyper advanced stuff and not to be trifled with until you ve mastered all of the first level egg techniques Not really It s still pretty darn easy Simple Simmered Meat Flank steak with scallions Thinly sliced meats can be cooked in a matter of seconds directly in the pot Chicken breast pork tenderloin or flank steak are all great candidates I like to pick the pieces up one at a time and swish them back and forth in the hot broth until cooked while the noodles are simmering then set the cooked meat aside and put it back on top right before serving Cured meats like ham or bacon are great as well as are cooked meats like leftover chicken or steak or hot dogs Want something really interesting Add a bit of shredded up beef jerky as your noodles cook It lends a nice smoky saltiness to the broth and achieves a really delightful tender chewy texture And that s about it for the basics of ramen cookery Once you ve mastered all of the simple methods upgrading your noodles is simply a matter of combining various techniques to achieve delicious end results The most obvious ones are simplified ramenified versions of classic East Asian dishes A dash of fish sauce and lime juice along with some beef and herbs quickly converts a bowl of noodles into a delicious Faux Pho pictured up top Add some shrimp and coconut milk and you ve got yourself a quickie version of Thai style Tom Kha Goong Stir fried beef and snap peas With care you can even make drier stir fried or cold noodle dishes The key here is to stop cooking the ramen just before it s completely done then drain it It ll continue to soften a bit from the residual heat as well as cooking further when you stir fry it or add a hot sauce As with all stir fries the goal is to have your pan hot enough before adding ingredients that you get a nice quick sear before anything can overcook or turn to mush When stir frying ramen I like to use part of the seasoning packet as a marinade for my meat Cook the meat and vegetables in a hot skillet with oil before adding then noodles and whatever sauce you d like plain old oyster sauce with a touch of sesame oil is an easy crowd pleaser I like the simple combo of flank steak with snap peas Fake ramen based Pad Thai also makes use of this technique adding fish sauce peanuts vegetables and a touch of lime and tamarind paste if you ve got it for a quick easy stir fry that s actually better than most of the oversweetened gloppy stuff you get from second rate Thai restaurants Do things right and nobody will recognize your ramen when it s wearing its new Thai hat Aloha Ramen combines Spam pineapple and a fried egg for some authentic hyper traditional Polynesian island flavor Instant luau just add hot water Peanut butter and coconut make for a great chilled ramen salad and you can get in touch with your inner Chinese American steam table by throwing together a simple ketchup and pineapple based sweet sour sauce Sriracha optional For more complete instructions click through the slideshow above Ramincinnati chili Of course there s no reason to stay in Asia here Ramen takes well to Western flavors as well How about some cheesy chili ramen or a poutine like dish of toasted raw ramen with gravy and mozzarella Use real curd for authenticity s sake or just go with the shredded stuff if you d prefer Stir together cooked ramen with a simple gooey cheese sauce see our recipe here or if you d prefer just a block of microwaved Velveeta thinned out with a bit of water then pop the whole thing in the toaster oven for a Ramac Cheese with a melty center and nice golden brown crust Remember when Spaghetti Tacos were a thing Well here come Ramen tacos to take their place Adding a pack of crunched up ramen noodles to the beef filling in a standard American taco kit add bulk texture and a whole boatload of fun and yes that s fun with an exclamation point Go Go Ramacos Canned soups can be bulked up nicely with instant ramen Cream of mushroom onion whatever you d like will work but my favorite is to add a can of creamed corn some sliced bacon and perhaps a shot of heavy cream or milk to a pot of simmering ramen for an instant sweet and smoky corn chowder A sprinkle of freshly sliced scallions completes this elegant soup from a more civilized age Wear a jacket and don t let your tie dip into the bowl Ramepherd s pie But for the ultimate in fusion comfort food Ramen topped shepherd s or cottage pie is the way to go Mashed potatoes can be a pain in the butt to make for such a simple dish Why not just boil some noodles and use them as your pie crust instead The top of the noodles dry out and become super crisp under the broiler while the noodles underneath remain tender It s a uniquely delicious textural contrast and one that I believe can help bring the world together Of course we re barely scratching the surface here Ramen may be one of the cheapest foods in the supermarket but with imagination and a bit of cross cultural cross class love it can be one of the most versatile staples in your pantry Check out the slideshow for more recipes and ideas then tell me What do you do to fancify your ramen 1 of 20Faux Pho Cook the noodles according to package directions using only half of the seasoning packet To the broth add the juice of 1 lime a tablespoon of sugar 2 teaspoons of fish sauce and a good pinch of pepper flakes if desired Transfer to a serving bowl then add 1 to 2 ounces thinly sliced flank steak it ll cook in the broth a handful of bean sprouts and some mixed herbs basil cilantro mint as desired 2 of 20Simple Add ins Quickly upgrade the flavor of any bowl of ramen by stirring in miso paste chili bean sauce Thai curry paste Japanese curry powder fish sauce or vinegar If it s a salty condiment omit about half of the seasoning packet You can also add spices white pepper sichuan pepper or chili flakes are great oils sesame oil chili oil or citrus lemon or lime Or whatever you feel like of course 3 of 20Instant Snack Don t have boiling water Just crunch up the noodles in the bag tear off a corner add the seasoning packet hold the torn corner and shake it up then consume Lick your fingers clean after this one It s like eating Cheetos but without the orange fingers 4 of 20Simple Eggs Eggs are one of the most versatile additions The easiest thing to do is add the eggs to the cold water before you start cooking Bring the water to a boil let it boil for a minute or two then add your noodles If you timed everything right the eggs will be hard or soft boiled just as the noodles finish cooking You can also cook the noodles then stir in a beaten egg or cook the noodles pull them off heat and drop an egg into the center Cover the pot and let the egg poach for 2 minutes before adding the seasoning and serving Stir the semi liquid yolk into the broth to enrich it 5 of 20Simple Vegetables For quick cooking vegetables like baby spinach sliced cabbage or frozen peas just add them after you pull the noodles off heat Some vegetables like broccoli cauliflower or thick snap peas can go in the pot about 2 minutes before its done boiling 6 of 20Simple Simmered Meat Thinly sliced meats can be cooked in a matter of seconds directly in the pot Chicken breast pork tenderloin or flank steak are all great candidates I like to pick the pieces up one at a time and swish them back and forth in the hot broth until cooked while the noodles are simmering then set the cooked meat aside and put it back on top right before serving Cured meats like ham or bacon are great as well as are cooked meats like leftover chicken or steak or hot dogs 7 of 20Bacon and Napa Cabbage A simple meat veg combo Add 2 slices of bacon cut into 2 inch strips and a couple ounces of sliced napa cabbage to the pot 2 minutes before the noodles finish cooking The bacon will inevitably get picked out and devoured before anything else but no worries like the sweet purple milk left behind by the marshmallows in the Lucky Charms the bacon leaves behind a lingering smoky richness that makes those last drops of broth the best part of the bowl 8 of 20Stir fried Beef and Snap Peas Toss a quarter pound of thinly sliced flank steak with half of the seasoning packet then simmer the noodles just until they break apart don t overcook them Drain the noodles and set them aside In a large wok or skillet heat a tablespoon of oil until smoking Add the beef and cook without moving for about 1 minutes until well browned Toss the meat a few times Add a quarter pound of snap peas and stir fry for about 1 minute Add another tablespoon of oil the noodles the rest of the seasoning packet a couple tablespoons of oyster sauce and a bit of sugar Toss until everything is well coated then plate it up Top with sliced scallions if your goal is to impress 9 of 20Aloha Ramen I don t know if anyone in Hawaii would go anywhere near this but I think it s pretty awesome super salty sliced of pan fried spam sweet pineapple chunks you can use fresh or canned a perfectly fried sunny side up egg fried in the same pan as the spam of course and a generous squirt of Japanese style barbecue sauce You can find this in most Asian grocers look for the bottle with the bulldog on it or you can make a quick version at home by mixing 2 tablespoons of worcestershire sauce a tablespoon of soy sauce and a half cup of ketchup together E \\\\u02bbai ka kou 10 of 20Tom Kha Goong Spicy sweet and sour coconut scented tom kha goong is a snap when you start with instant noodles After boiling and draining the noodles just add half the seasoning pack to a couple cups of coconut milk along with fish sauce sugar and Thai curry paste to taste wanna make it even easier Just use regular old sriracha in place of the curry paste Serve it with cilantro and limes for squeezing A few strips of chicken or peeled shrimp added to the noodles a few minutes before they re done simmering makes for an instant upgrade 11 of 20Cold Peanut And Coconut Ramen Salad Somewhere between a Thai style peanut dipping sauce and a cold sesame noodle salad You can barely recognize the low brow roots of this classy rendition Boil the noodles as directed then drain them and add them back to a pot filled with cold water Meanwhile mix together a couple tablespoons of peanut butter chunky and half of the seasoning packet along with 1 teaspoon of soy sauce and a tablespoon or so of chili garlic sauce yes sriracha works too more or less to taste Add just enough water to get it to a nice saucy consistency then toss in the noodles along with some chopped cilantro peanuts and unsweetened coconut flakes Coat thoroughly serve immediately and wait for the compliments to start rolling in 12 of 20Sweet Sour Ramen It s tacky it s bright red it s made with ketchup but it s good Cook the ramen just until they break apart then drain and set aside Heat a tablespoon of oil in a wok or skillet and stir fry some bell pepper along with a few chunks of spam until everything s nice and hot or if you d really like some pork or chicken pieces Add a small can of pineapple chunks along with their juice a half cup of ketchup and chili garlic sauce to taste Toss with the noodles and serve with a side of irony 13 of 20Rad Thai Real pad thai is tough The rice noodles go very quickly from undercooked to overcooked With ramen based pad thai expectations go out the window which makes it significantly easier to meet them Cook your noodles just until they start to separate adding a few peeled shrimp to the pot a couple minutes before they finish cooking Pull the pot off the heat then drizzle in a lightly beaten egg Drain and transfer everything to a large bowl Add half the seasoning packet a few nice squirts of fish sauce plenty of lime juice crushed peanuts scallions bean sprouts and if authenticity is your schtick some tamarind paste I just leave it out the lime juice is plenty sour on its own Nobody will recognize your ramen when it s wearing its new Thai hat 14 of 20Cheesy Chili Ramen Now we get into the realm of fusion ramen and this is an obvious first step Taking a cue from Cincinnati the noodles are simply cooked drained and topped with a ladel of chili I ve used goopy cheese sauce here but you can go the authentic route with shredded cheese if you d prefer Heck you can even take it all five ways by adding onions and beans 15 of 20Routine Ramen Poutine Okay before someone goes and calls the Mounties on me yeah I know real poutine is made with cheese curd not shredded cheese like I ve got here But hey this is a ramen hack so deal with it To get your ramen nice and crispy just crunch them up in the bag then empty it out into a skillet with a little oil Toast over medium high heat while tossing and stirring until everything is nice and golden brown Top it all off with some gravy and cheese and broil in the toaster oven until melty Eat with a fork And beer 16 of 20Ramacos So Spaghetti Tacos may have finally died out but the ramen taco trend is just in its infancy Climb on board before this thing goes worldwide It s easiest to start with a taco kit the kind that comes with shells taco sauce and a seasoning pack Cook up about half the amount of ground beef recommended on the box then add a pack of raw crunched up ramen noodles along with the water and seasoning packet to the skillet Cook it down until the ramen is the desired texture I like mine still a bit crispy adding more water as necessary Scoop it into taco shells top as desired and chow down 17 of 20Ramen Corn Chowder An elegant soup from a more civilized age A balanced sweet salty smoky chowder with tender kernels of corn To make it start by crunching up the noodles in the bag then transfer them to a saucepan along with a can of creamed corn and a few strips of bacon sliced up Fill the empty creamed corn can with water and add it to the pot Add half the seasoning packet then bring the whole thing to a simmer and cook until the noodles are nice and tender The soup will thicken up into a thick chowder which you can thin out as desired Add a handful of thinly sliced scallions and you re good to go Want some extra decadence Replace the water with milk or cream and swirl in a bit of butter before you serve it This is a dish best served with a tie on 18 of 20Ramac Cheese An obvious selection no Unlike real elbow macaroni the ramen itself is almost as goopy as the cheese sauce making this dish texturally interesting You can use homemade cheese sauce or just use a half block of Velveeta mixed with some milk and butter heat it up in the microwave until gooey Combine the cooked noodles with the cheese sauce top with more cheese and broil until brown and bubbly 19 of 20Ramepherd s Pie Sounds weird tastes delicious A traditional shepherd s or cottage pie filling gets topped with cooked ramen noodles then baked The top of the noodles dry out and become super crisp under the broiler while the noodles underneath remain tender It s a uniquely delicious textural contrast See the next slide for the recipe 20 of 20Ramepherd s Pie Start by cooking a half pound of ground beef in a large skillet with a bit of oil Add a half cup of choped onion along with half of the seasoning packet and a bit of water Add some frozen peas season to taste with salt and pepper then transfer to a pie plate a gratin dish or a cast iron skillet Top with cooked ramen noodles then broil until brown and crispy on top the mobile version of serious eats the mobile version of

       "  u'{title:Hydrogen Peroxide Anti viral Antibacterial Anti fungal ,body:html Hydrogen Peroxide Anti viral Antibacterial Anti fungalNatural Effective Anti viral Anti bacterial Anti fungal The following was written by Becky R of Indiana a doctor s wife I would like to tell you of the benefits of that plain little ol bottle of 3 peroxide you can get for under 1 00 at any drug store My husband has been in the medical field for over 36 years and most doctors don t tell you about peroxide or they would lose millions of dollars 1 Take one capful the little white cap that comes with the bottle and hold in your mouth for 10 minutes daily then spit it out I do it when I bathe or shower No more canker sores and your teeth will be whiter without expensive pastes Use it instead of mouthwash 2 Let your toothbrushes soak in a cup of peroxide to keep them free of germs 3 Clean your counters table tops with peroxide to kill germs and leave a fresh smell Simply put a little on your dishrag when you wipe or spray it on the counters 4 After rinsing off your wooden cutting board pour peroxide on it to kill salmonella and other bacteria 5 I had fungus on my feet for years until I sprayed a 50 50 mixture of peroxide and water on them especially the toes every night and let dry 6 Soak any infections or cuts in 3 peroxide for five to ten minutes several times a day My husband has seen gangrene that would not heal with any medicine but was healed by soaking in peroxide 7 Put two capfuls into a douche to prevent yeast infections I had chronic yeast infections until I tried this once or twice a week 8 Fill a spray bottle with a 50 50 mixture of peroxide and water and keep it in every bathroom to disinfect without harming your septic system like bleach or most other disinfectants will 9 Tilt your head back and spray into nostrils with your 50 50 mixture whenever you have a cold plugged sinus It will bubble and help to kill the bacteria Hold for a few minutes then blow your nose into a tissue 10 If you have a terrible toothache and cannot get to a dentist right away put a capful of 3 peroxide into your mouth and hold it for ten minutes several times a day The pain will lessen greatly 11 And of course if you like a natural look to your hair spray the 50 50 solution on your wet hair after a shower and comb it through You will not have the peroxide burnt blonde hair like the hair dye packages but more natural highlights if your hair is a light brown faddish or dirty blonde It also lightens gradually so it s not a drastic change 12 Put half a bottle of peroxide in your bath to help rid boils fungus or other skin infections 13 You can also add a cup of peroxide instead of bleach to a load of whites in your laundry to whiten them If there is blood on clothing pour directly on the soiled spot Let it sit for a minute then rub it and rinse with cold water Repeat if necessary I could go on and on It is a little brown bottle no home should be without With prices of most necessities rising I m glad there s away to save tons of money in such a simple healthy manner 14 I use peroxide to clean my mirrors with there is no smearing which is why I love it so much for this Hydrogen Peroxide is described as an effective anti viral antibacterial and anti fungal and can be used for anthrax decontamination This sort of supports the effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide don t you think Also your body makes hydrogen peroxide to fight infection which must be present for our immune system to function correctly White blood cells are known as Leukocytes A sub class of Leukocytes called Neutrophils produce hydrogen peroxide as the first line of defense against toxins parasites bacteria viruses and yeast Simply put it is the oxygenation of the body Sickness and tumors are generally oxygen hating growths which thrive in oxygen poor bodies 15 Gargle with hydrogen peroxide put drops in the ear and nose to end colds flu chronic sinusitis including polyps and infections 16 Use as a vegetable wash or soak to kill bacteria and neutralize chemicals 17 Disinfect your dishwasher or refrigerator 18 Use it on trees and plants as a natural fungicide insecticide and as a weed killer 19 Clean with hydrogen peroxide when your house becomes a biohazard after its invaded by toxic mold such as those with water damage Throughout the world hydrogen peroxide is used instead of chlorine as a safer and eco friendly municipal water purifier Some use H2O2 in pools and spas Dr Edward C Rosenow author of 450 published medical papers and associate at the Mayo Clinic for over 60 years proved more than 70 years ago 1914 that bacteria could be found consistently in the lymph nodes that drain joints J A M A April 11 1914 He was probably the first scientist to postulate that H2O2 would help arthritis because of its ability to supply oxygen to oxygen hating organisms causing arthritis Streptococcus viridans Click Here for e book 101 Home Uses Of Hydrogen Peroxide Hydrogen peroxide in the ears for the flu and colds Although it would appear to contradict what we are taught about the flu and colds many people have tried hydrogen peroxyde in the ears with great success Hydrogen peroxide works quite well and is supposed to be effective about 4 times out of 5 especially if done when the symptoms first appear In 1928 Dr Richard Simmons hypothesized that colds and flu virus enter our bodies through the ear canal It was Dr Simmons hypothesis that contrary to what we have been taught we usually can catch the two via the ear canal and not through the eyes or nose or mouth as most of us believe Dr Simmons findings were dismissed by the medical community According to Dr Simmons keeping your fingers out of our ears will greatly reduce our chances of catching colds and the flu but we need to keep in mind that these 2 are microscopic and can be air born and may land on in our ears Once these microscopic bodies have entered the inner ear they then begin to breed and from there they have access to every avenue throughout our bodies to travel and infect and make us sick Remarkable results can be achieved in curing colds and the flu within 12 14 hours when we administer a few drops of 3 Hydrogen Peroxide H2O2 into each ear The H2O2 starts working within 2 3 minutes in killing the cold or flu There will be some bubbling and in some cases mild stinging might occur I do this myself and I can assure you that it is not painful in any way It tickles more than anything Wait until the bubbling subsides usually a few minutes then drain onto a tissue and repeat with the other ear Although this practice is perfectly safe for infants and children to use the loud bubbling and stinging may frighten them and they will need someone they trust to put the hydrogen peroxide in their ears DO NOT get hydrogen peroxide in the eyes if you do flush with water Many people have also successfully used the 3 Hydrogen Peroxide solution in ears packed with wax to help loosen it up after it has been soaked with oil for a few minutes olive oil usually works best Other uses for hydrogen peroxide What else is 3 hydrogen peroxide good for You can make your kitchen a safer cleaner place and eliminate bacteria without exposing yourself or your family to toxic chemicals which also damage the environment You can use a simple safe disinfecting spray which is more effective than any of the commercial cleaners in killing bacteria In addition it is also inexpensive What you need is 3 hydrogen peroxide the same strength available for disinfecting wounds or gargling and plain white vinegar or apple cider vinegar and 2 clean spray bottles When cleaning fruits or vegetables simply spray them well first with both the vinegar and the hydrogen peroxide and then rinse them off with water It doesn t make a difference which one you use first you can spray either with the hydrogen peroxide followed by the vinegar or with the vinegar and then the hydrogen peroxide There won t be any lingering taste of hydrogen peroxide or vinegar and neither is toxic to you even if a small amount were to remain on the produce The sprays of hydrogen peroxide and vinegar do an exceptionally good job at sanitizing counters and other food preparation surfaces such as wood cutting boards In tests performed at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University 1 combining the 2 mists eliminated virtually all Salmonella E coli bacteria or Shigella on heavily contaminated foods and surfaces when used in this manner making this spray combination more effective at destroying these potentially deadly bacteria than any commercially available kitchen cleaner or chlorine bleach In one study the best results were obtained when one used one spray right after the other this method was several times more effective than using either mist by itself and more effective than mixing both liquids in one spray bottle References 1 Science News

       "  u'{title:What Is the Genotype Diet what is the genotype diet?,body:I never count calories I m at my dining room table writing this I just ate a pound of roast beef with rice curry on the side For dessert I m having a large piece of extra dark 82 percent chocolate Yup chocolate s on my diet I eat it every day How many calories is all this Don t know don t care Now you may be saying Michael roast beef I already tried the Atkins diet My colon shut down my cholesterol went through the roof my skin turned greasy gray and in two months I gained back twice as much weight as I lost Or you may be saying Whoa I did low carb I had no energy I yelled at my kids my hair was falling out and my grandmother begged our parish priest to perform an exorcism I m Italian I need my pasta My diet is not Atkins And it s not low carb Please notice the rice curry and the chocolate So what s wrong with these diets After all the anecdotal evidence says that they re great for some people But that s the problem Different bodies have different needs Then what are we supposed to do Shop around until something clicks Use ourselves as guinea pigs Been there done that I lived on raw vegetables and stayed in bed all day I went low fat and my hair turned gray I went low carb and I became the meanest person I knew I went Atkins and I smelled like a boys locker room in a Georgia heat wave Then I tried the Blood Type diet But wait This article is titled What is the Genotype Diet Let me explain Peter D Adamo N D ND stands for Naturopathic Doctor has written a series of books outlining his theory that our blood types A B AB or O largely determine what foods are good for us The basic book is Eat Right for Your Type There s also a great video titled Understanding the Blood Type Diet And if you don t know your blood type there s an easy 9 95 test that you can take at home I tried the blood type diet I followed the O version and it improved my energy and immune system But I still caught a lot of colds It s an occupational hazard of working with sick people And after the weight initial loss I stayed the same weight But I was in for a surprise The following year I found out that Dr D Adamo had made his categories more specific According to his new book Change Your Genetic Destiny there are six genotypes each with its own needs its own evolutionary story its own strengths and weaknesses There are also five brief videos about this that you can play online Are you a hunter or a gatherer A teacher or a warrior A nomad or an explorer Well it s more complicated than knowing your blood type You ll have to take a good look at yourself You ll need a tape measure fingerprinting equipment and about an hour I had it easy I took half an hour but I m easy to figure out Everything about me from my long shinbones to my sharp teeth yells Look out world this is a hunter Hide the cat But once I had that figured out I could look up specific lists of foods at the end of the book Example I found out that chocolate acts as a thermogenic for me This means that it s a fat burner Of course it has to be mostly chocolate not sugar milk or soy But still chocolate as medicine Who knew But whoever your are you ll find similar pleasant surprises plus some admittedly disappointing news Whoever you are the list of good foods is long and yummy And there are outline recipes for each Genotype that will tickle your taste buds You can even specify a recipe for say duck One such recipe is for Warm Duck Salad with Enoki Mushrooms and Pine Nuts Good for a hungry hunter So this diet is not for ascetics The Genotype approach emphasizes what you CAN eat not what you can t The focus is not on self denial but self knowledge I believe the work of figuring out your Genotype is worth it And this goes back to my first rule of good health Knowledge is power Read up Ask questions Ask your doctor if they think a particular style of eating is right for you Today I stand 5 6 and weigh 103 lbs I actually asked a clinician friend Be honest Am I anorexic She snorted With your coloring Your muscle tone Your energy And after I saw what you can do to a roast turkey Please And I haven t gotten sick once since I went on this diet But again what works for me may not work for you So you want to count calories Be my guest But know that there s an alternative Meanwhile I m figuring out what to have for dessert tonight What do you think Chocolate covered almonds Or banana slices with chocolate sauce Or sticky rice with pear butter Decisions decisions Follow Michael Boblett on Twitter www twitter com Michael Boblett what, is, the, genotype, diet?, health according to the genotype diet, there are six genotypes, each with its own needs, evolutionary story, strengths and weaknesses. it has worked for me, but everyone&#39;s body is different. according to the genotype diet, there are six genotypes, each with its own needs, evolutionary story, strengths

       "  u\"{title:Why doctors might be turning on ObamaCare USATODAY com column: why doctors might be turning on 'obamacare',body:The final verdict may not be in yet but some of the early returns on ObamaCare are not good Indeed many doctors are becoming wary of the law at a time when only one in three Americans support it ColumnsIn addition to its own editorials USA TODAY publishes a variety of opinions from outside writers On political and policy matters we publish opinions from across the political spectrum Roughly half of our columns come from our Board of Contributors a group whose interests range from education to religion to sports to the economy Their charge is to chronicle American culture by telling the stories large and small that collectively make us what we are We also publish weekly columns by Al Neuharth USA TODAY s founder and DeWayne Wickham who writes primarily on matters of race but on other subjects as well That leaves plenty of room for other views from across the nation by well known and lesser known names alike In late December a survey of 501 physicians was released by the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions research group whose parent company serves clients in the health care industry Nearly half 48 expected health reform to hurt their incomes this year while 73 said it would not reduce costs Though this isn t a scientific survey and other such surveys have and will show physicians support for the Affordable Care Act the early glimpse of the law s potential impact will likely lead to economic pain for doctors and a diminished system for their patients Indeed the Deloitte survey found that 69 of the physicians are pessimistic about the future of medicine because of the law I m not here to judge doctors who back ObamaCare But as a practicing physician I simply need to look at the economics of medicine apply my own experience and see the law as it unfolds to know that physicians across this country should be demanding if not a new system at least a better one The early daysIn June 2009 when President Obama attended a white coat ceremony at the American Medical Association headquarters in Chicago and this organization of physicians roughly 17 are members went on to deliver its endorsement of the president s legislation physicians had a nagging question Did we agree with the AMA s position or was the organization taking us for a ride The answer is becoming clearer as the law is being implemented An online survey in September by the Jackson Coker physician recruitment firm based on 1 611 doctors who chose to respond reflected that the majority of doctors don t believe that the AMA represents their views The primary reason the AMA s support of the legislation Just 13 of those surveyed backed the Affordable Care Act Doctors traditionally have been unhappy with insurance mandates because third party payers whether public or private represent a seemingly unnecessary interface between us and our patients Many doctors today prefer to accept cash even at a great discount rather than having to deal with the burden imposed by insurers Yet the glaring inadequacy of the health care reform law is that putting the bureaucratic burdens on steroids does little to change the trajectory of health care spending The law also floods the system with patients while tightening the financial screws on those in the health care industry We re two years into this experiment and the realities of the law more regulations more patients with low paying insurance higher costs but lower payments to doctors are sinking in When surveyed by Deloitte 83 of doctors said one likely change to the medical system as a result of the law would be increased wait times an inevitable outcome of insuring millions more patients without a matching increase in the number of doctors Not too surprising Most doctors surveyed also noted that the changes will pose considerable implementation challenges I suspect it would be hard to find someone in the health care industry or any employer for that matter who would disagree with that expectation And it doesn t get betterIt s one thing to mandate insurance for all but quite another to do so without incentivizing physicians or those considering the profession In fact the law does the opposite For many doctors there becomes a financial disincentive to practice medicine The Association of American Medical Colleges estimates that the USA will be 160 000 physicians short by 2025 when all patients would be insured under ObamaCare and this is without even considering those doctors who will limit their practice to insured patients because of decreasing reimbursements or who retire early when faced with increasing costs with little return Doctors are catching on fast to the essential deficiencies of ObamaCare but so are America s patients The concern of doctors is reflected among the American people Support for the law has sunk to 29 in the latest Associated Press poll Think of ObamaCare as a heavy horse drawn cart loaded with all of America s patients and best technologies As the cart gets heavier and heavier does it make sense that we don t add more horses but instead feed the ones we have less and less while expecting them to pull the additional weight I think more and more doctors are going to pull up lame if the law s many shortfalls aren t addressed and stat Marc Siegel a physician is an associate professor of medicine and medical director of Doctor Radio at NYU Langone Medical Center He is the author of The Inner Pulse and a

       "  u'{title:The Infamous Jacques Torres Chocolate Chip Cookies ,body:Now I have a chocolate chip cookie recipe that I swear by I love it I think it is incredible and I haven t changed my mind about that However as much as it pains me to say it these chocolate chip cookies by Jacques Torres are absolutely without a doubt the best chocolate chip cookies that I have ever made or tasted in my entire life I guess that s why they call him Mr Chocolate These are a chocolate chip cookie of another color that s for sure To begin they use both cake flour and bread flour that s right there is no all purpose flour to be found in these beauties Secondly the dough must and I repeat must be refrigerated for a minimum of 24 hours I know that this sounds strange for some chocolate chip cookies but trust me The combination of the flours and overnight refrigeration is extraordinary The result is a chewy cookie with just the right amount of crisp around the edges They are perfectly soft while still being just firm enough to stay together while you take them to work to share with co workers package them up to send to friends around the world or squeeze them close so that nobody can pry them from your cold dead hands The other difference is that the recipe recommends that you use Jacque Torres chocolate disks which can be found here I however did not have these so I used Guittard semi sweet chocolate baking pieces that I chopped up as well as Guittard 60 cacao bittersweet chocolate chips which are actually very large and worked perfectly as a replacement I really liked the different textures of chocolate to be honest so I recommend deviating from the original recipe just a tiny bit and using two kinds of chocolate if you can Either way I made these and everyone that tried them went nuts I ended up making around 100 cookies so I mailed some to a friend living in Seattle who said that he ate them for dinner when he got them brought some into my office gave some to the doormen at work and gave a bunch to Kramer to take into his office The response was unanimous best cookies ever They disappeared from my office s kitchen in record time People especially loved the salt and massive amounts of chocolate surprise surprise These are the real deal folks so I really recommend setting aside an extra day to make your chocolate chip cookies and give these a try I think that you will be as happy with them as we were Your ingredients I doubled this recipe hence the insane or completely normal if you know me amount of butter Whisk together the cake flour bread flour baking soda baking powder and salt Set aside Beat together the butter and sugars until light and fluffy at least 3 minutes Beat in the eggs one at a time followed by the vanilla Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed Add in the flour mixture very gradually until just moistened Fold in your chocolate Now press plastic wrap down onto the top of the dough being sure it is completely covered and refrigerate for a minimum of 24 hours I let mine go for about 36 hours but you can let it go for as long as 72 hours This is an important step Now when you are finally ready to bake preheat your oven to 350 degrees F and scoop the dough out onto greased and or lined baking sheets I used a 40 ice cream scoop which is about the size 2 tablespoons You can use something larger for monster cookies which is always fun it just depends on how many you want to bake Sprinkle with a little sea salt and bake for 18 20 minutes for large cookies or 10 12 minutes for smaller cookies I think mine went for about 11 minutes Allow your cookies to cool for a few minutes on your baking sheets then move them to another surface to finish cooling completely although you may just have to try one warm they are amazing Milk is in fact an essential component to enjoying these amazing cookies Jacques Torres Chocolate Chip Cookiesfrom The New York TimesPrint this recipe Total Prep and Baking Time 1 hour 30 minutes plus 24 hours to chill the doughYield 18 20 large cookies I used a 40 ice cream scoop which is a bit more than 2 tablespoons and got about 40 cookies 2 cups minus 2 tablespoons cake flour1 2 3 cups bread flour1 1 2 teaspoons baking powder1 1 4 teaspoons baking soda1 1 2 teaspoons coarse salt2 1 2 sticks 1 1 4 cups unsalted butter room temperature1 1 4 cups light brown sugar packed1 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar2 large eggs room temperature2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract1 1 3 pounds bittersweet chocolate disks or f\\\\u00e8ves at least 60 percent cacao content now I did not have these so I used Guittard 60 cocoa bittersweet chocolate chips as well as about 1 2 pound of semi sweet Guittard chocolate pieces which I chopped I loved the look and texture of this combination sea salt or fleur de sel for sprinkling 1 Sift together the cake flour bread flour baking soda baking powder and salt into a medium sized bowl and set aside 2 In the bowl of your mixer cream together your butter and sugars until light and fluffy about 3 5 minutes Add in the eggs one at a time until combined scraping down the bowl as needed Add in the vanilla and mix Gradually add in the dry ingredients until just moistened Fold in your chocolate until evenly added throughout the dough Press plastic wrap against the dough making sure it is completely covered and refrigerate for at least 24 hours or as long as 72 hours I left mine for 36 hours 3 When you are ready to bake bring the dough to room temperature so that you can scoop it out and preheat your oven to 350 degrees F Line and or grease your baking sheets Scoop your dough out onto the sheets I used a 40 ice cream scoop which is about the size of 2 tablespoons but you can make them even larger if you like Do not press the dough down let it stay the way it is Bake 10 12 minutes for smaller cookies mine took about 11 minutes or 18 20 minutes for larger cookies 4 Allow the cookies to cool slightly on your baking sheet then move them to another surface to cool completely You can enjoy these warm room temperature or cold Store in an air tight container at room temperature for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 2 months

deadly rays of prosaic 1960 s cuisine We re about to dive into the world of comfort food Can cuisine be prosaic I ll have to ponder that today All I know is this I had a baby Then I had another baby Then I had a third baby a boy After my third baby a boy was born I found myself back on the ranch with two young daughters and yet another suckling infant and I was starving all the time If I wasn t eating Cinnamon Toast Crunch by the truckload I was gnawing on a divine Mexican chicken casserole my BFF Hyacinth brought me or a box of Krispy Kreme doughuts my father in law picked up the city That was back in Krispy Kreme s glory days It all helped my milk production But still I was starving And then one dark and stormy night my good friend Beth a ranching neighbor of ours and her mother Diane also a longtime rancher knocked on my door and brought me dinner They brought me meatballs I won t wax rhapsodic about how much these meatballs changed my life They were so simple so savory so comforting and warm and delicious I almost cried Come to think of it I think I did cry I always thought it was my hormones regulating to normal levels But maybe it was totally meatball induced Here s how you make the babies Start with 1 1 2 pounds ground beef This is home grown baby His name was Alfie Grab some oats And pour in 3 4 cup Pour in 1 cup of milk Now cut an onion in half from root to tip then cut one of the halves in half again Peel off the outer layer and make very thin vertical slices Rotate it 90 degrees then make slices downward to create a thin dice Go over them with the knife several times to get them really fine or your family will stage a mutiny Big onion chunks are not welcome here Throw in 3 tablespoons onions into the meat mixture Followed by 1 1 2 teaspoons salt And plenty of black pepper Yes the black dust stuff There s a time and a place for fresh ground But it isn t here Now just stir the mixture until it s all combined Now we just need to form the mixture into balls I like using this small cookie dough scoop so they re all uniform in size Just scoop the meat into your hand And roll it into a neat ball Place the meatballs on a cookie sheet as you go When you ve rolled all the meatballs place the cookie sheet into the freezer for about five minutes just to make them easier to work with If you have a six year old son he can help you with the rolling Look at this freaky photo It looks like his arm is coming out of the side of his head doesn t it I can t quit staring at it Trivia This is the baby referenced at the beginning of this post After five minutes remove the meatballs and throw some flour onto a plate Dredge the meatballs in flour And there you have it Mexican Wedding Cookies Hope you enjoy Just kidding We re not through yet And these aren t Mexican Wedding Cookies Just heat 3 tablespoons canola oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat and throw in 1 3 of the meatballs All we re doing here is browning them quickly on both sides We don t want them to cook all the way When they re brown remove them to a baking dish and continue browning the rest of the meatballs Now just set them aside while you make the sauce Or if you re organized you can whip out the sauce when the meatballs are chilling in the freezer To a bowl add 1 cup ketchup 2 tablespoons sugar 3 tablespoons white vinegar 4 to 6 tablespoons chopped onion A couple splashes of Tabasco if you re feeling ornery And two tablespoons Worcestershire sauce Mix it together well Now just pour the sauce evenly over the top of the meatballs Now just pop em in a 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes You ll know they re done when your house smells so good you want to marry it They should be sizzling around the edges Mmmm Oh I m sorry Did someone say Mmmmm Oh wait It was me These really are so delicious folks They re almost like little meatloaf balls with a lot more flavorful surface area than a big slice of meatloaf And the sauce is just a classic sweet sour ketchup concoction and it makes you think of Grandma My kids love this dish which is a miracle And they re delicious warmed up the next day and placed on a toasted sandwich bun with melted mozzarella on top Yikes Note that these meatballs are not in the same category of regular Italian meatballs that would go in Spaghetti and Meatballs those have more of a breadcrumb parsley Parmesan flair These are more in the comfort food meatloaf category If you d like to serve them with pasta regular egg noodles tossed in a tiny bit of melted butter would be divine For the mashed potato recipe click here

       "  u'{title:How Good Were We at Predicting the Future ,body:2010 The number itself has a very sci fi texture to it As we approach the beginning of a new decade we can t help but look back Less than sixty years ago book authors filmmakers cartoonists economists and scientists were all predicting some pretty incredible things for the human race at the outset of the 21st century Some were slightly off in predicting that we d already be flying around the galaxy in spaceships while others were as accurate as imagining a world under surveillance in which every household worshiped the images projected from giant television screens The following is a look at some of these mid 20th century predictions and how they measure up to the realities of today Futurology Futurology is the practice of examining probable possible and preferable futures along with the myths and worldviews that accompany them Practitioners attempt to select the trends that might continue the changes which will take place and anything unusual that might occur Making these predictions requires an understanding of past and present trends and information gathered from various disciplines in order to create a number of possible futures These futures usually comprise of the possible preferable probable and chance futures These views are then scrutinized and challenged by others to test their validity Energy Predictions It was predicted that atomic energy and solar power would be more prominent in the year 2000 because it would be illegal to pollute the air by burning coal Some predicted that science would have the capability to create street lamps that gave off light by bombarding atoms with electrons Energy Today As of 2009 there has been a significant amount of research and development on solar power Germany and Portugal have developed large multi megawatt photovoltaic plants This source of energy is not always available but scientists are decent at predicting the best times for this source of energy Research and development on this type of green technology is ongoing It is known that nuclear power plants cause certain problems due to their radioactive waves and nuclear waste that said in 2007 nuclear power plants accounted for about 14 of the globe s electricity Street lamps have been improved since the 1950 s but not to the level that some predicted Many street lamps use photocells so that they turn on when it is dark Housing Predictions It was predicted that there would be significant advances in chemistry that would allow for cheap but reliable synthetic material to be created Materials like poured plastic would replace bricks stone and wood to build houses These houses would have a life span of only 25 years and the low price tag of 5 000 The best thing about having a house created chiefly out of waterproof plastic is that when it comes time to doing your house cleaning the only equipment needed is a hose The soapy water is disposed of through a central drain followed by a blast of hot air These synthetic materials have made the need for mechanization close to zero For example there are no dishwashers since all dishes can be dissolved in ultra hot water The few utilities that are still required such as air conditioning and outlets are contained in a central room that the house is built around Housing Today Instead of being able to purchase a house for 5 000 the price of real estate has gone up quite a bit higher houses sell for more than ten times this amount Besides inflation part of the reason for this may be that the building supplies still primarily consist of brick stone metal and wood Instead of being less mechanized many houses in the 21st Century include a variety of mechanized appliances such as dishwashers washers dryers blenders etc There are even robots that can help with your housework Food Predictions It was predicted that food would also benefit from the advances in the chemical industry Food would be converted from sources such as wood pulp sawdust and even old underwear into sugary foods like candy There was also a belief that the majority of food products would be delivered in frozen blocks that would be heated up by an electric stove eliminating the art of cooking in many households Medical professionals would also have a deep understanding of how the body metabolizes food and how hormones work This knowledge about nutrition would allow for improvements to be made to the aging process 70 year olds will look 40 and the average life span would increase to 85 and beyond Food Today While our chemists have not found a way to transform our old underwear into sugary food products there is a rather extensive list of frozen foods and meals available to the public Interestingly enough the amount of salt and unhealthy fats used in these frozen meals are a major contributor to obesity and other maladies linked to poor nutrition such as type 2 diabetes Considerable amounts of research is available to the public concerning proper nutrition yet poor eating habits are more of a problem now due to the availability of fast foods Our life spans may have increased but we have not used our knowledge of nutrition and biology to lessen the effects of aging to the extent that was predicted Electronics Predictions It was predicted that there would be advances in the field of technology that would allow people to see each other while having a conversation this would be used by businesses for international conferences It would also be possible to TV shop since department stores would display their products on televisions for people to order Most interesting was the prediction that machines would have some form of intelligence so that they would all be able to work together as one unit to manufacture a specific product One machine would receive the instructions and then dole out orders to all of the other machines It was even predicted that there would be a weather machine available that combines forecasting with quick calculating in order to accurately predict the weather When a hurricane is predicted oil would be poured in to the sea and lit on fire in order to create a vacuum in order to stop the hurricane before it reaches the coast Electronics Today Electronics have come a long way The days of paperwork and filing are becoming increasingly obsolete and now businesses turn to exchange hosted services to help them run more efficiently and protect them from e mail spam and malware Words that would have sounded like gibberish twenty years ago Moreover video conference calls are available to businesses during the 21st century as are videophone calls which enable two people to have a conversation and see each other at the same time The use of webcams with instant messaging over the internet is another way in which people can interact visually and converse at the same time When it comes to shopping via the television there are infomercials available for people to view products and order them if they are interested The prediction for automated assembly lines was close the majority of automobile production takes place on one of these We do not have AI at the moment but research is ongoing Similar to AI we are still working on making our weather predictions more accurate so that we can at least prepare for the day Transportation Predictions It was predicted that with the advances in technology and growth of cities that transportation would adapt Trains will no longer be a common mode of transportation They will remain a necessity when it comes to the transporting of products too large for air travel Liners would be another popular vessel for the shipping of cargo there is more room because they are automatic and no longer have to carry large amounts of fuel It was believed that the popularity of automobiles would decline these tear drop shaped vehicles would be driven from the rear by a high compression engine that runs off of denatured alcohol It was predicted that cars would be limited to short trips and that private helicopters would be the vehicle of choice for commuters that or large public aerial buses As for air travel it was believed that there would be supersonic planes that could reach speeds of 1 000 miles an hour These would be available to rich business men who could afford a ticket The rest of the population would still be able to use jet planes for their long distance travel needs Traveling Today During the 21st Century trains are still a major mode of transportation when it comes to moving large cargo however the predictions were off when it came to passenger usage Not only are trains still a popular mode of transportation but there have been significant developments made to increase their efficiency For example the use of subways as a mode of public transportation exists in certain major cities and there are high speed rails available in various countries This is a train that is capable of reaching speeds as high as 125 mph depending on how new the tracks are Ocean liners are still used to carry cargo and to offer leisurely cruises However liners still require a large amount of fuel to operate Helicopters have not replaced cars as the most common form of transportation for commuters the gas fueled automobile is still on top but there has been work on developing electric cars There was a point where supersonic flight was available for passenger travel but this is no longer in practice in fact the last supersonic flight took place in 2003 Jet planes are the most common method of air transportation Space Station Predictions The producers of 2001 A Space Odyssey had predicted space stations to look like this Space Stations Today Here s what they look like today Medical Predictions Predictions for the field of medicine also coincided with the belief that there was going to be major progress in the chemical industry It was predicted that we would have antibiotics gathered from the soil and other moulds which could be synthesized along with other chemical agents in factories These would be used in something called chemotherapy Advances in medical equipment would coincide with this Microscopes use electron beams to magnify 30 100 thousand times allowing protein molecules to be seen Along with advances in chemistry these developments have led to cures for common viruses like the flu An ECG is no longer needed to examine the heart of a patient now one only has to step in front of a fluoroscopic screen and turn on the x ray for the photoelectric cell to examine all areas of the heart Diseases of the nervous system such as MS and Parkinson s have been linked to the electromechanical process and treatment for these is available For example it is possible to use a small battery operated machine to stimulate and reactivate your nerves to help with Parkinson s disease Medicine Today The predictions made about antibiotics turned out well since they are used to treat numerous maladies Chemotherapy is also in existence it is often used to treat cancer because it eliminates cells which divide quickly With regards to the predictions concerning medical equipment there are electron microscopes which can magnify an image up to 1 million times However our advances in the field of chemistry have not reached the level where this technology could be used to find a cure for diseases like the common flu Hospitals still use ECG although in an advanced and more compact electronic form Fluoroscopic screens are also available to doctors in the 21st Century But there is no small battery operated machine that can help with Parkinson s hopefully with the campaigning that Michael J Fox is doing to raise awareness about Parkinson s treatment like this will not be too far off The degree of accuracy for these predictions is quite decent it would be odd if all of these predictions had been dead on What these predictions did do was give the population circa 1950 s an educated idea of what the new millennium might bring ,url:blog sherweb how good were we at predicting the future}',\n",

firesheep developer: facebook ignoring huge security problem,body:Story Published Nov 11 2010 at 11 57 PM PDT Story Updated Nov 19 2010 at 12 19 AM PDT SEATTLE On a recent afternoon I surprised a lot of people at a coffee shop in Seattle s Capitol Hill neighborhood I walked in sat down got onto the caf\\\\u00e9 s free Wi Fi network and fired up a free application called Firesheep With a minute the names of a dozen people on the same wireless network started to appear in the Firesheep program The users were listed along with the names of multi billion dollar websites like Facebook Twitter Amazon YouTube and The New York Times In some cases the person s Facebook profile picture would also appear making it easy for me to identify them in the caf\\\\u00e9 With a simple click on the user s icon in Firesheep I could log into their account on Facebook or Twitter or a variety of other websites that do not use encryption to fully protect the browsing session with their users I could easily assume someone else s online identity and do nearly anything I wanted with their account Firesheep is a frighteningly simple tool that streamlines techniques malicious computer hackers have used for years to gain unauthorized access to personal accounts on the internet Firesheep takes these previously complex tasks and rolls them into a user friendly program that even an average computer use like me can figure out It s like you are in my house and I did not invite you said a surprised Sarah Dooley After her Facebook icon appeared in my Firesheep list I approached her as she typed away on her iBook I showed on my computer her main Facebook page and described the simple steps it took to get into her account This is scary and I m glad you showed me she said Making network intercepts easy Firesheep is a free extension for the Firefox web browser It was created by Eric Butler a Seattle programmer and first presented at a security convention in San Diego in October In the first three weeks of its release Firesheep has been downloaded more than 700 000 times and that number continues to grow daily Watch an extended interview with Firesheep developers Eric Butler and Ian Gallagher Butler s creation listens to the digital traffic on the network the user s computer is connected to It s listening for a cookie that s term coined for a tiny bit of identifying information a user s computer exchanges with a website Cookies are what allow you to stay on a website that requires a user name and password without logging in every time you click to another page But cookies are vulnerable to being hijacked if they are sent on an unencrypted connection Firesheep has built in filters that listen for people on an unsecured network who may be exchanging information with websites like Facebook A user s initial log in to Facebook is encrypted and not vulnerable to hijacking But every subsequent exchange between a Facebook user and Facebook s servers in what s called a session is unencrypted and it s these exchanges Firesheep is catching Firesheep lets its user essentially grab that cookie out of the air and place it on their computer In doing so the Firesheep user can take over the identity of the Facebook user and alter almost anything in the account except for the initial login password I wrote Firesheep because I was tired of having to deal with websites that were ignoring this problem of user privacy Butler told me in his first interview since releasing Firesheep Hopefully sites like Facebook and Twitter will see this and decide protecting user privacy is a priority for them The elephant in the room The security software programmer admits that Firesheep simplifies the hijacking process to the point a novice user can figure it out but said he doesn t think the tool turns good people into evil people It s important to note that an attacker who s motivated has always been able to do this Butler said Butler and co developer Ian Gallagher believe the security lapse with websites that contain a person s private information has been ignored to such a great extent that something eye opening had to be done Users of these sites don t realize that this is happening but the companies have known about this for a long time and have chosen to ignore this problem Instead they are putting money in privacy features and not making their websites secure Butler said Those privacy controls don t really matter if you can steal an entire user s session or you can see everything they are doing said Gallagher who help trouble shoot the plug in It s the elephant in the room they ve been disregarding Reached by e mail for comment a Facebook spokesperson said the company is making progress offering encrytped connections throughout the site and hopes to provide it as an option in the coming months As always we advise people to use caution when sending or receiving information over unsecured Wi Fi networks the spokesperson said in a written statement Legal questions Butler s intent may be noble but the repercussions of the release of Firesheep could create unknowing lawbreakers Watch Washington State Attorney General Rob McKenna discusses wiretapping laws and network security I think when you are in a coffee shop and just doing your business online if someone is intercepting everything you re doing I think it s quite likely a violation of our state s wiretapping law and perhaps the federal wiretapping law as well said Washington State Attorney General Rob McKenna McKenna had never seen Firesheep until I showed him He said he hasn t seen any case law that would suggest simply viewing another person s information obtained over unsecured Wi Fi network through a program like Firesheep is illegal but he believes it is Other legal scholars have argued that it s more ambiguous Jonathan Gordon a Los Angeles attorney who consults for internet companies told Computerworld that there is no expectation of privacy on an unsecured wireless network and wiretapping laws make an exception for that Think of an unsecured network like a crowded airport lobby When you shout to someone across the lobby there s no expectation of privacy for what you re yelling Being on an unsecured Wi Fi network like the kind you ll find at many coffee houses and internet cafes is the electronic version of being in a crowded airport lobby But there s no debate if a person s information gathered with Firesheep or other tools is used to make a post or tweet without the account user s consent That is illegal and considered stealing someone s identity according to McKenna Butler however would likely be held harmless if someone uses Firesheep to commit an illegal act The maker of the crowbar isn t guilty of burglary because a burglar uses it to break into a house McKenna said It s not the creator of the tool that s liable it s the user of the tool Butler said he s not an expert in wiretapping laws but believes sites like Facebook are responsible for the information they keep and should be held liable for not protecting that information Every website that is dealing with personal information and a user account really should be using encryption for everything he said That s really answer He adds that using a virtual private network will also prevent Firesheep from capturing your network traffic Butler cautions everyone who thinks that simply putting a password on a Wi Fi network will offer complete protection He says it doesn t If the Firesheep user is using a common or shared user name or password to gain access to a network anyone else using the same user name and password could be subjected to hijacking Other tips and precautions Look for an https in the address bar of the website you re visiting It may be there when you log into the website but if it s not there after you ve logged in anything you send could be easily hijacked by someone using Firesheep Sites that keep an https in the address bar during the entire session are using encryption and cannot be accessed with Firesheep Banks commonly use https for the user s entire online session If you are on an open and unsecured Wi Fi or wired network do

GIRL RAPED BY DEVIL DAD Courageous Colleen Stan strolls through the park breathing in the fresh air and enjoying the sun on her face As she walks she says a silent prayer for Elisabeth Fritzl the girl raped and caged for 24 years in a stifling dungeon by her evil dad For as the world struggles to take in the tragedy unfolding in Austria Colleen knows how it feels to live that nightmare She was just 20 when she was seized by psychopath Cameron Hooker and kept as a sex slave for seven years Colleen was regularly raped whipped strung up from hooks and stretched on a home made torture rack in his cellar And for 22 hours a day she was entombed in a suffocating wood COFFIN under the bed Hooker shared with his WIFE Colleen now 51 said Seeing pictures of the Austrian cellar brought back terrible memories My heart goes out to Elisabeth and her children People can t take in what she endured or how she could survive 24 years in a hell like that But I know I was taken away from the world too locked up in a terrifying black place and totally controlled by someone else I thought I was fated to die in that coffin But I got my life back and I want Elisabeth to know it IS possible to live again and feel free Californian Colleen tells her remarkable story in a Channel 5 documentary on Wednesday The Girl In The Box was made long before the world heard of Elisabeth s ordeal at the hands of devil dad Josef 73 who fathered seven children with her But it gives a moving insight into her mind and torment Colleen was snatched in 1977 as she was hitchhiking in California She was picked up by Hooker 23 his wife Janice and their eight monthold baby Pals thought lumberjack Hooker was a hard working family man But at home he was a fiend obsessed with sado masochistic sex who had struck a sick bargain with his brutalised wife If she let him use a slave to feed his vile lust he would stop abusing her Minutes after picking Colleen up Hooker pulled over and held a knife to her throat He bound and gagged her and forced her into a plywood box Colleen recalled I thought I was going to suffocate Back home Hooker dragged her to the basement stripped her hung her by the wrists from hooks and whipped her Speaking in a calm quiet voice Colleen said He did things to me I never believed possible too sick for me to describe For the first few months he set out to break me I was kept in the dark not allowed to wash given a bedpan and fed once a day on scraps or potatoes I was in constant fear and every time he tortured me I thought Am I going to die now I was electrocuted burned with a heat lamp and he also made a rack and would stretch me by pulling on huge chains Colleen s family alerted police when she vanished but cops found no trace of her She said I had to give over my body and soul to him and all I could do was concentrate on staying alive Colleen was forced to sign a slave contract making her Hooker s property He changed her name to K told her to wear a dog collar and convinced her he was part of The Company a sinister group that would kill relatives of slaves who tried to escape Hooker later moved his family to a cramped mobile home and kept Colleen in a box under the bed he shared with Janice It was 6ft by 3ft with a smaller inner coffin containing two air holes and a bedpan she could only move with her feet Colleen said I d lie there for 22 hours at a time only being allowed out to be tortured But after two years he started to let her out to do chores And when he had absolute power over her he even took her to visit her overjoyed family for 24 hours Colleen said I had to pretend he was my fiance and I was in love I even posed for a photo with my arms around him I wanted to scream out the truth but I was terrified for their lives and mine I totally believed The Company would kill them As soon as Hooker got her back to his place he locked Colleen in the coffin again and she spent the next three years inside The only respite were regular rape and torture sessions But in 1984 Hooker broke his pact with his wife and began abusing Janice again He also announced he wanted two MORE sex slaves Terrified Janice began studying the Bible and took pity on Hooker s captive Colleen said She told me we had to get away she thought he was going to kill us both Then she said there was no such thing as The Company That one small truth was enough to make me realise I d been brainwashed and for the first time in seven years I knew I was in control of my life The women fled in August 1984 and Colleen went home At first she could not tell her family what had happened But two months later Janice shopped Hooker to cops and Colleen asked her parents to hear her own police statement She said It broke their hearts but once they knew the truth I could start moving on Hooker was later given a 135 year jail sentence Mum of one Colleen has since married twice and now works as an office manager She is writing a book about her life and also helps women who have had violent relationships And she hopes her recovery will give the Fritzl family hope Colleen said I have had expert counselling amazing support from my family and I have great faith in God I just hope Elisabeth takes advantage of every bit of help offered to her too I m sure she can learn to live in the world again because she never gave up hope in those 24 People can t take in what Elisabeth endured or how she could survive 24 years in a hell like that But I know and I want her to know it is possible to live again and feel free ic network courageous colleen stan strolls through

       "  u'{title:chicken adobo 9 66 recipe 1 61 serving ,body:chicken adobo 9 66 recipe 1 61 serving I first became interested in chicken adobo when I saw a recipe for it using a slow cooker It looked delicious but completely different than the adobo that I was familiar with I thought adobo was that rich spicy reddish brown mexican sauce that comes with chipotle peppers The recipe I saw didn t even involve any chile peppers So I started doing some research Turns out Filipino adobo is a completely different beast than Mexican or Spanish adobo This adobo is a tangy salty mix of vinegar soy sauce garlic and spices that is used to marinate and stew meat After looking at a plethora of adobo recipes I decided that I didn t even need a slow cooker Not only was it easy but it only required a few ingredients that I already had in my pantry The result was super tender juicy tangy chicken that can be served over rice or cellophane noodles YUM I used bone in drumsticks and thighs for this recipe but you could really use any cut of chicken you d like or beef or pork for that matter I removed the skin off of the thighs but left it on the drumsticks just because I didn t know which I d prefer The skin on was definitely better It crisps up nicely in the last step and keeps the meat nice and moist Total Recipe cost 9 66Servings Per Recipe 6 Cost per serving 1 61Prep time 10 min Cook time 45 min Total 55 min INGREDIENTS COST 4 lbs skin on bone in chicken 7 96 1 2 cup soy sauce 0 48 1 2 cup apple cider vinegar 0 48 2 Tbsp vegetable oil 0 082 Tbsp honey 0 212 whole bay leaves 0 101 Tbsp minced garlic 0 201 Tbsp black peppercorns 0 15TOTAL 9 66 STEP 1 Arrange the chicken pieces in a large pot in one layer Remove the skin if desired STEP 2 Combine the rest of the ingredients soy sauce vinegar honey oil garlic bay leaves peppercorns in a bowl and whisk until the honey is dissolved Partially crush the peppercorns if desired Pour the marinade over the chicken Cover and refrigerate for a few hours or over night STEP 3 When you re ready to make the chicken add just enough water so that the liquid comes just up to the top of the chicken about 1 2 cup Cover the pot with a lid place the pot over a high flame and bring it up to a rolling boil When it reaches a boil reduce the heat to medium low and let simmer for 30 minutes STEP 4 Preheat your broiler on high Remove the chicken from the pot and place it on a broiler pan or a sheet pan with wire cooling racks placed on top Place the chicken under the broiler until it is brown and crispy on top 5 10 minutes depending on your broiler STEP 5 While the chicken is broiling turn pot with the soy vinegar liquid up to high and bring up to a rapid boil Allow the liquid to boil heavily until it is reduced in volume by approximately one half You may need to boil it for 5 10 minutes longer than the chicken is in the oven to get it to this point STEP 6 Use a soft brush to baste a few layers of the reduced soy vinegar liquid onto the browned chicken Serve over rice or noodles and spoon more of the reduced liquid over top Step By Step PhotosI used 2 lbs of chicken thighs and 2 lbs of drumsticks I guess I kind of failed here because I paid more per pound for these bone in and skin on chicken pieces than I did for my boneless skinless chicken breasts last week Oops Anyway you can use any cut of chicken that you d like but dark meat really does well with this recipe and having the skin on keeps the meat moist and gets crispy when broiled I m going to marinate right in the cooking pot just to make things easier You can marinate in a large ziplock bag if you want more even coverage but this worked just fine for me Plalce the chicken in a single layer in the pot In a small bowl whisk together the remaining ingredients until the honey has dissolved that s soy sauce vinegar oil honey garlic bay leaves and black peppercorns Pour the marinade over the chicken place the lid on the pot pop it in the fridge Let it marinate while you re at work over night or just for a few hours When you re ready to cook add a little bit of water so that the liquid comes a little closer to covering the chicken You don t want to add too much or else it will take too long for the sauce to reduce later Cover the pot with a lid place the pot over a high flame and bring it up to a boil Once it reaches a boil reduce the heat to medium low and let it simmer for 30 minutes The chicken should be cooked through by this point but it s not too pretty so we re going to broil it Turn the broiler on to high Boiled chicken is just so blond and sickly looking so we re going to add color under the broiler If you don t have a broiler pan you can create a make shift one by placing some wire cooling racks over a baking sheet After you pull the chicken out of the simmering liquid turn it all the way up to high and let it boil furiously while you finish the chicken You want it to reduce in volume and concentrate in flavor as much as possible Place the chicken under the broiler for about 5 10 minutes or until it gets a nice brown color to it The time it takes will depend on how hot your broiler is and how close you have your rack to the heat it should be fairly close So you ll just have to keep an eye on it You should hear crackling and popping as the skin begins to crisp Once the soy vinegar liquid has reduced in volume by half use a brush and baste a few layers onto the chicken This will add moisture and tons of flavor You can serve the chicken over rice or noodles I suggest spooning more of the reduced liquid over top of the chicken and the rice or noodles ,url:budgetbytes blogspot 2011 07 chicken adobo 966 recipe 161 serving html}',\n",

       "  u\"{title:Poe Toaster a No Show in 2011 Culture ,body:One of the best pieces of arcana of American letters is the man known as the Poe Toaster Every year on January 19 Edgar Allan Poe s birthday the toaster appears in the Baltimore graveyard where the author is buried and leaves a half empty bottle of cognac and four roses No one knows his identity or his motives Last year for the first time in 60 years the mysterious man did not show up Last night he failed to show up again leaving many to think that the tradition is now over Four impostors showed up each leaving the roses and the cognac But Jeff Jerome the curator of the Poe House and Museum who watches the grave in secret from the neighboring church said none of the claimants gave him the special signal that the real Poe Toaster gives him every year nor did they arrange the roses correctly In fact the Poe Toaster already passed on his legacy to his sons but they never seemed to have taken it seriously and now may have just given up entirely it was very cold last night In 1993 the visitor began leaving notes starting with one that read The torch will be passed A note in 1998 indicated the originator of the tradition had died and passed it on to his two sons The sons didn t seem to take the duty as seriously as the father One left a note in 2001 referencing the Super Bowl and another in 2004 implying criticism of France over its objections to the U S invasion of Iraq upsetting many of the traditionalists When the Poe toaster didn t show last year Mr Jerome theorized that the 200th anniversary of Poe s birth in 2009 might have been considered the appropriate stopping point I like to imagine the sons of the Poe Toaster feeling incredible guilt and meeting some sad punishment for not carrying out their father s legacy as would befit people tied up in a Poe story As is you have to imagine the impostors will continue Perhaps we can anoint one of them the new Poe Toaster as this tradition is simply too poignant for us to give up And really the poor soul needs his cognac Image of a 2009 imposter s attempt via Wikimedia Commons for the second year in a row, the mysterious poe toaster failed to celebrate poe's birthday in the traditional manner. is he dead?,url:good is post poe toaster a no show in 2011}\",\n",

       "  u\"{title:Groovy Recipes That Are So Granola NPR ,body:Expecting the usual oat flavor of most store bought granolas I was blown away by the spices that hit my tongue cardamom pistachio brown sugar Unlike the granola I had been eating all of my life the flavors in this homemade batch kept me going back for more Few foods are so closely associated with their history that they become adjectives Yet we know what it means to call something granola The word has come to represent the 1960s of peace love and health foods Even the consistency of granola crunchy often is used as a synonym My enthusiasm for granola was rekindled recently one morning at work when the chef put out a large serving of her homemade granola for the restaurant staff to try She served it with a bowl of Greek yogurt and pomegranate seeds to sprinkle on top Having already eaten a full breakfast I decided to try a small portion grabbing a glass coffee mug and filling it with just a touch of each sample Expecting the usual oat flavor of most store bought granolas I was blown away by the spices that hit my tongue cardamom pistachio brown sugar With each spoonful I felt the cool smooth yogurt the crunch and flavor of the granola and the sweet tangy juice that released when my teeth found one of the bright red pomegranate seeds As my spoon hit the bottom of the mug I was already on my way back for seconds then thirds then fourths At last as I peered into the clear bottom of the coffee cup I commanded myself to stop Unlike the granola I had been eating all of my life the flavors in this homemade batch kept me going back for more Though it is strongly associated with the 1960s granola has been around for more than a century In 1863 sanitarium owner James Jackson created a graham flour product for his patients He called it granula Eve Turow is a native Chicagoan with a passion for cooking eating and writing about food She is beginning a new blog to document her upcoming trip through Southeast Asia hoping to discuss education yoga and of course food Forty years later at another sanitarium John Harvey Kellogg created a similar product substituting oats for graham flour He too called it granula until he was sued by Jackson Kellogg renamed his dried cereal granola Granola did not really catch on however until a century later The healthful eating movement of the 1960s started with young adults rejecting generation old political views as well as processed foods With an emphasis on whole grains and organic ingredients cereal companies such as Kellogg Post and Quaker Oats decided to rebrand and remarket their whole grain granolas In 1972 Pet Inc introduced Heartland Natural Cereal with the other cereal companies following close behind And in 1975 Nature Valley rolled out the first granola bar Today shoppers can find granola in any flavor vanilla peanut butter chocolate raspberry maple cranberry and with a variety of mix ins sunflower seeds cashews chocolate covered pretzels and shredded coconut With so many options it can be hard to find one product with all the preferred ingredients Some consumers like dried fruit while others do not Some want a sweeter more indulgent granola and others want the bare bones oats There are even websites where you can order your own custom made granola Once I tasted the chef s homemade concoction I decided to give it a go myself To my surprise the delectable breakfast treat was a cinch to make no long hours toiling in the kitchen even very few dirty pots and pans It was so easy I made several batches and packaged them as holiday gifts pleasing and surprising several family members and friends Then I used the leftovers to fuel more creations granola bars granola cookies and granola scones I had to throw out the last few granola bars because I couldn t keep myself from eating them my sister told me How did you make those Proud of my creation I almost did not want to confess how easy they were to put together Granola remains a comfort food for those seeking a way to sweeten or add nutrients to their morning meal Some even use it as a snack on the go a way to fuel up for a long day at work or an afternoon hike Though labeling something granola generally calls to mind a Birkenstock and tie dye clad free spirit its name truly represents a dedication to whole grains and nutrition So go ahead call me granola or even crunchy just let me keep my cardamom hinted honey glazed wholesome oat granola January 25 2011 This is the granola recipe that brought me back for more While coated in a decadent honey

butter Dried fruit optional banana apple or mango Rolled oats are steamed then rolled providing the flat texture best for granola Instant oats are partially cooked and quick cooking are finely cut much like steel cut oats which are thinly sliced by steel yet retain some bran Rolled oats will provide the right texture and will cook properly in granola recipes Use any nuts you want in any combination pecans almonds pistachios hazelnuts etc Get the untoasted ones Chop by hand with a nut chopper or with a few pulses in a food processer Position racks in middle of oven and preheat to 300

fragrant about 30 minutes Rotate pans halfway through Cool granola completely If you like large sheets of granola remove with a large spatula If you like clusters let the granola cool until it won t burn your hands then shape into handfuls Add dried fruit if desired after the granola is cooled January 25 2011 This recipe is the ultimate breakfast treat Using the Indulgent Granola recipe this is a

       "  u\"{url:healthline health blogs study roundup traffic pollution lung damage 101212,title:Traffic Pollution May Cause Long Term Lung Damage to Children ,body:by Alexia SeversonThe GistChildren who are exposed to traffic related air pollution during infancy particularly those with allergies could suffer diminished lung function later in life according to a recent study published in the American Thoracic Society s American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine While earlier studies have shown that long term exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with reduced lung function in children the role of timing of exposure as well as the possible effects of this long term exposure remained unknown But in this prospective birth cohort study researchers found that early life exposure to traffic related air pollution could have long term respiratory consequences in susceptible children up to 8 years of age with stronger effects indicated in boys children with asthma and children sensitized to allergens The Expert TakeIn order to assess the effects of long term exposure to air pollution on lung function in school age children G\\\\u00f6ran Pershagen professor at the Karolinska Institute of Environmental Medicine in Stockholm Sweden and his colleagues followed more than 1 900 children from birth through age eight with repeated questionnaires spirometry and immunoglobulin E measurements Outdoor concentrations of particulate matter from road traffic were estimated for residential daycare and school addresses using dispersion modeling which is a mathematical simulation of how air pollutants disperse in the atmosphere Researchers associated a 5th to 95th percentile difference in time weighted exposure to outdoor concentrations of particulate matter from road traffic during the first year of life with a reduced forced expiratory volume in one second at age eight This negative association was particularly pronounced in boys and children with allergies or asthma After the first year of life however exposure to traffic related air pollution had less of an impact on future lung function in children These results add to a large body of evidence demonstrating the detrimental effects of air pollution on human health Pershagen said The TakeawayKeeping your infant away from all traffic pollution is nearly impossible but there are a few things you can do to minimize their exposure to harmful environmental particles The March of Dimes Foundation offers these tips for keeping your child healthy When local health agencies issue air pollution or smog alerts keep your child indoors If you must take your baby out on these days do so early in the morning or after sunset If you know you live close to a source of air pollution or if your baby has a heart or lung problem including asthma ask your child s healthcare provider how to best protect your child from air pollution Buy efficient cars and trucks that pollute as little as possible The Environmental Protection Agency has a vehicle emissions guide Use compact energy efficient fluorescent light bulbs When handling the bulbs try not to break them because they contain mercury Properly dispose of paints pesticides and solvents Examples of solvents are turpentine paint thinners and grease removers Your local health department or environmental agency can tell you how to do this Store these products in airtight containers Avoid using paint sprayers Keep air conditioning units heaters furnaces wood stoves and fireplaces in good working order If the air inside your home is stagnant and doesn t get replaced very often the indoor pollution that results could worsen symptoms of allergies asthma or other chronic lung problems Source and MethodFrom 1994 to 1996 4 089 newborn infants were recruited to the prospective cohort study from four municipalities in Stockholm Sweden The response rates were from 96 percent to 84 percent for the one and eight year questionnaires In addition 2 630 children 64 percent of the original cohort attended a clinical examination at age eight including maximum expiratory flow volume tests and blood sampling Moving out of the study area and unwillingness to participate were the main reasons for dropout from the clinical follow up Time weighted average outdoor levels for the different time windows were calculated using emission inventories and a Gaussian air dispersion model Short term exposure was estimated using daily air quality measurements and meteorological data from urban background and rural monitoring stations This study had a few limitations Calculations of particulate matter concentrations were only performed for the year 2004 and were extended into to the other years of follow up and some miscalculation of individual exposure levels was likely Other ResearchA number of studies have shown the negative effects of long term exposure to ambient air pollution on children s respiratory health However little research has looked at lung function and traffic air pollution in this particular context and many of the previous studies exhibit inconsistent or imprecise results A children s health study conducted in California showed associations between community average pollutant concentrations and diminished lung function development in children aged 10 to 18 years old The observed effect remained statistically significant in the subgroup of non asthmatics but the asthmatic children were too few for precise risk estimation Similarly a birth cohort study conducted in Oslo Norway indicated stronger air pollution effects in asthmatic children compared with nonasthmatics More on Healthline com children who are exposed to traffic-related air pollution during infancy, particularly those with allergies, could suffer diminished lung function later in life, according to a recent study published in the american thoracic society's american journal of respiratory and critical care medicine. }\",\n",

       "  u'{title:Chocolate Cupcakes with Vanilla French Buttercream Shut Up Bake ,body:01 Feb 2009 by shutupandbake in Baking Cupcakes Tags chocolate cupcake Cupcakes vanilla frosting I was lucky enough to be around a couple weeks ago to see the Martha Stewart cupcake show She featured some of her own recipes and also had the owners of Butter Lane in NYC come on the show and demonstrate how to make some of their delicious cupcakes Being in Miami I of course can t go there and taste one myself so I decided to make them I actually used a different chocolate cupcake recipe from Martha s website because the Butter Lane one called for cake flour which I didn t have on hand today So I chose Martha s Chocolate Cupcakes which has pretty much the same ingredients but with all purpose flour Here are the ingredients you need 3 4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder3 4 cup all purpose flour1 2 teaspoon baking powder1 4 teaspoon salt3 4 cup 1 1 2 sticks unsalted butter room temperature1 cup sugar3 large eggs1 teaspoon vanilla extract1 2 cup sour cream Sift the cocoa flour baking powder and salt in a bowl and set aside Next it s time to cream the butter and sugar Now add the eggs one at a time And lastly add half the flour cocoa mixture followed by the sour cream and then the rest of the flour mixture Divide the mixture into a single cupcake pan And bake for 20 25 minutes at 350 degrees The easy part is over Now it s time for the frosting This one I did steal from Butter Lane their Vanilla French Buttercream I cut this recipe in half since I only had 12 cupcakes The first step was to melt the sugar into the egg whites over a saucepan of simmering water while constantly whisking so that the eggs wouldn t cook Next you have to beat the egg white mixture into oblivion or until stiff peaks form Add the cream of tartar and keep beating Then you have to add the wet ingredients This is where it seemed that all my hard work was for naught Once I started added the butter the mixture became much more gooey and no longer was stiff Finally add the vanilla This recipe calls for vanilla beans but I obviously wasn t going to spend the money on that so I just used extra vanilla extract You then have to chill the frosting I went above and beyond the 15 minute chill time I let it sit in the fridge for an hour I was ready to frost my cupcakes I wanted to practice my decorating skills so I broke out my pastry bag and tips However this frosting was not meant for piping It slid right off the cupcake I gave up on that and wielded a knife Much better Not only did these cupcakes look delicious but they taste amazing I was so excited I had a cupcake photo shoot Please click on these for a larger image ,url:shutupandbake wordpress 2009 02 01 chocolate cupcakes with vanilla french buttercream}',\n",

       "  u'{title:Bush Re Authorizes Martial Law Provisions ,body:President George W Bush has sparked much alarm by openly declaring himself to be a dictator in the event of a national emergency under new provisions that will effectively nullify the U S constitution but such an infrastructure has been in place for over 70 years and this merely represents a re authorization of the infrastructure of martial law New legislation signed on May 9 2007 declares that in the event of a catastrophic event the President can take total control over the government and the country bypassing all other levels of government at the state federal local territorial and tribal levels and thus ensuring total unprecedented dictatorial power The National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive which also places the Secretary of Homeland Security in charge of domestic security was signed earlier this month without the approval or oversight of Congress and seemingly supercedes the National Emergency Act which allows the president to declare a national emergency but also requires that Congress have the authority to modify rescind or render dormant such emergency authority if it believes the president has acted inappropriately Journalist Jerome Corsi who has studied the directive also states that it makes no reference to Congress and its language appears to negate any requirement that the president submit to Congress a determination that a national emergency exists In other words the new directive excludes Congress altogether from governance in a state of emergency While alluding to the enduring constitutional government the directive actually ensures the end of constitutional government as each branch the executive legislative and judicial are stripped of equal authority and must answer directly and solely to the President The mainstream media has not reported on the directive and the White House has refused to comment Earlier this month it was reported that a high level group of government and military officials has been quietly preparing an emergency survival program named The Day After which would effectively end civil liberties and implement a system of martial law in the event of a catastrophic attack on a U S city Though anathema to any notion of liberty or freedom this new legislation has not come out of the blue it is merely an open declaration of the infrastructure of martial law that the federal government has been building since the turn of the last century which was first publicly codified in the 1933 war powers act under Franklin D Roosevelt Senate Report 93 549 which was presented at the first session of the 93rd Congress outlines just a handful of the declared national emergencies or martial law declarations that preceded the latest one The Internet leader in activist media Prison Planet tv Get access to hundreds of special video reports audio interviews books and documentary films Subscribers also get instant access to our hugely popular forum where you can network with like minded people meet up and get active Click here to subscribe Since March 9 1933 the United States has been in a state of declared national emergency In fact there are now in effect four presidentially proclaimed states of national emergency In addition to the national emergency declared by President Franklin D Roosevelt in 1933 there are also the national emergency proclaimed by President Harry S Truman on December 16 1950 during the Korean conflict and the states of national emergency declared by President Richard M Nixon on March 23 1970 and August 15 1971 In alliance with these open declarations of martial law and the 1947 National Security Act bills such as the Patriot Act the John Warner Defense Authorization Act and the Military Commissions Act have all put the final jigsaw pieces in place to complete an infrastructure of dictatorship since 9 11 We re already living under an infrastructure of martial law and have been since 1933 all that remains for it to be fully implemented is a big enough natural disaster mass terror attack or other catastrophe that will cause the necessary carnage and panic that affords the federal government enough leeway to implement open dictatorship with the least possible resistance New revelations that Bush has openly declared himself to be a dictator are both shocking and demand immediate attention but they only represent a re authorization of the tyranny that Americans have been living under for at least the past 74 years ,url:prisonplanet articles may2007 230507martiallaw htm}',\n",

       "  u'{title:chocolate pudding pie smitten kitchen ,body:A lot of times a recipe comes with a story and if you re even luckier it s a good one There are dishes that remind you of something your mama used to cook and unforgettable meals at far flung restaurants that demand recreating in your own kitchen and fresh stuff that looked so pretty at the market you had to come home and have your way with it This is not any of those times I don t have a good story about why I had to make a chocolate pudding pie this weekend or why you should before your weekend is done and gone and I at first felt bad about this until I realized that at 37 weeks and 4 days pregnant not that anyone is counting or anything one does not need a good reason to make chocolate pudding pie they are the definition of one Because did you read the part about the chocolate And pudding And pie I did I saw those three words together on Gourmet com last week and had I been craving chocolate pudding before then No Did I know I was fixing for some pie Nope Did I have a good reason to make it Well not exactly but I promise you if you make chocolate pudding pie the people will come Though you might have to then share it with them which is inconvenient when you realize how good it tastes It may not bring out the magnanimity in you I at first typed magnitude but well that s just too easy but you ll be relieved to know that as far as pies this pretty go this one is particularly easy to make a quick baked shell filled with an even speedier homemade chocolate pudding and smothered with a generous helping of fresh whipped cream It s even easier to eat but I suppose that goes without saying even if you re not the pregnant est person in New York right now Want to make chocolate pudding but hold the pie shell Here ya go One year ago The Baked Brownie Spiced UpTwo years ago Lemon Layer CakeThree years ago Romaine Pesto and Egg Stuffed Tomatoes Chocolate Pudding PieAdapted from Gourmet One of my favorite things about this besides the whole CHOCOLATE and PUDDING and PIE thing is the way that despite its all id kid like nature this pie is surprisingly unsweet and not heavy There s barely a half cup of sugar in the whole she bang and the lack of excessive richness it s a milk and cornstarch pudding not a weighty egg yolk and cream custard makes for something you can easily crave on a hot summer day although you ve already been warned that that craving may strike without warning One half recipe of All Butter Really Flaky Pie Dough wrapped and chilled for at least 30 minutes Pudding filling 1 4 cup cornstarch1 3 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar divided3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder1 4 teaspoon salt3 cups whole milk4 ounces bittersweet chocolate not more than 60 cacao finely chopped1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract1 cup chilled heavy cream Bittersweet chocolate shavings for garnish optional Prepare pie dough Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into an 11 inch round then fit into a 9 inch pie plate Trim edge leaving a 1 2 inch overhang then fold overhang under and crimp edge decoratively Prick bottom and side of shell all over with a fork then chill shell 30 minutes While shell chills preheat oven to 375 F with a baking sheet on middle rack Line shell with foil and fill with pie weights Bake on baking sheet until pastry is set and edge is pale golden about 25 minutes Carefully remove weights and foil then bake shell on baking sheet until pale golden all over 15 to 20 minutes more Cool shell Make pudding filling Whisk together cornstarch 1 3 cup sugar cocoa powder and salt in a 2 quart heavy saucepan then gradually whisk tips alert in milk Bring to a boil over medium heat whisking constantly then boil whisking two minutes mixture will thicken Remove from heat and whisk in chocolate and vanilla until smooth Pour filling into cooled shell and chill its surface covered with wax paper if you want to prevent a skin from forming until cold at least two hours Just before serving beat cream with remaining two tablespoons sugar until it just holds soft peaks Spoon onto pie and garnish with bittersweet chocolate shavings if you re feeling fancy Do ahead Pie dough can be made and chilled up to two days Pie without whipped cream can be chilled up to one day before serving Whipped cream is best added at the last minute however I did find that ours held up surprisingly well for a day so far if you feel like winging it Detour This is where I admit that I for reasons both lengthy and boring I really loathe working with pie weights and use a different technique to blind bake pie and pastry shells Instead I freeze my rolled out shells for 20 to 30 minutes until solid press a piece of buttered foil buttered side down very tightly against the frozen shell and blind bake it according to regular directions When it is time to remove the weights I carefully pull back the foil and press any part of the crust that has bubbled up gently back with the back of a spoon and continue baking the shell Try it See more Chocolate Photo Pudding Tarts Pies Do more Link Bookmark Pin Print Email 233 Comments a home cooking

       "  u'{title:Jaay s Best Ever Chocolate Chip Cookies jaay&#8217;s best ever chocolate chip cookies,body:Update I have done a few things that in my opinion make these even better than the original recipe below I use only Turbinado sugar instead of a mix of processed white and brown sugars I use French or European style butter I add about a teaspoon of cinnamon I get 70 chocolate and chunk it with a knife instead of using chips when I can And sometimes I add about half a pound of bacon crisped up and in small pieces Now back to the original post Jaay Dunlap posted a chocolate chip cookie recipe in November 2006 on JustBaking net that sounded good enough I wanted to try it and man alive am I glad I did I ve made these before but never when I had the chance to get some shots of the process The recipe is simple and includes the same stuff that most any other recipe has There s sugar egg vanilla baking soda flour salt and chocolate chips or chunks in this case Oh I can t forget the butter There s definitely butter in these puppies What is different is the proportions of the ingredients This recipe calls for a 2 1 ratio of brown to white sugar I want to try making this with all Turbinado sugar to see how that works too Another major difference is that I d always read to cream the butter usually at room temperature with the sugars This recipe instead calls for using melted butter The formal recipe is listed at the bottom of this entry After the sugars and butter are mixed an egg and a yolk are added along with one tablespoon of vanilla and all that s blended together To that already sifted flour salt and baking soda are added The chocolate chips or chunks have to be stirred in by hand so they don t get all broken up by the mixer Next time I do these I m going to pre chunk chocolate I ll get a bar I think will go well and chunk it myself with a hammer That way I can try a variety of chocolates out instead of just getting the packages available if you do this just make sure to use chocolate that s not too sweet Here s yet another difference I found in making these cookies Each cookie is made with a whole quarter cup of batter I got a scoop at Sur La Table last month to use for the cookies The scoop didn t have a liquid measure listed on it so one of the women working there took me back into their teaching kitchen and we filled it with water than measured and it was exactly one fourth of a cup Perfect With the size of these cookies I only put about eight on a cookie sheet they need some room to spread out but they stay pretty well together and come out looking great The cookies take a while to bake being as large as they are but I tried taking them out when they seemed just slightly underdone as carryover seems to finish them well They took about 15 minutes in my oven using a Hearthkit The Hearthkit really helped the cookies come out very evenly baked and the convection setting on the oven does a really great job with baking Now everyone makes great chocolate chip cookies I know A coworker said his wife s were the best ever until yesterday I took a bunch into the office and no one came back telling me their cookies were better The coworker that bragged on his wife even took one home to her and they both agreed these are better The differences in proportions of ingredients the use of melted butter and the sheer size of these cookies are what make these so good The result is a cookie with a slightly crunchy exterior and a chewy interior with loads of chocolate And they stay that way for several days which is a feat unto itself Everyone s entitled to like their family s traditional chocolate chip cookie recipe though I bet a lot of those were just copied from the Tollhouse package These cookies though are so good you could sell them Trust me on this I have Recipe 2 cups all purpose flour 1 2 teaspoon baking soda 1 2 teaspoon salt 3 4 cup unsalted butter melted 1 cup packed brown sugar 1 2 cup white sugar 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1 egg 1 egg yolk 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F for pure convection adjust accordingly I used 310 F on convection Grease cookie sheets or line them with parchment paper or use a Silpat which is what I did Sift the flour salt and baking soda and set aside Mix the sugars and butter just until thoroughly mixed then add egg yolk and vanilla and mix until creamy Add the sifted ingredients and mix until just blended Stir in the chocolate chips chunks then drop dough 1 4 cup at a time on a cookie sheet about 3 inches apart and bake for 15 17 minutes Leave them on the cookie sheet to cool a bit when removed from the oven this is important they fall apart if you move them too quickly Once they cool a few minutes remove the cookies to a cooling rack to finish cooling Or eat them right away with milk Original content here is published under these license terms X License Type Read OnlyLicense Summary You may read the

youbeauty.com,body:Spring has sprung And with it the fashion runways of the world have exploded in a kaleidoscope of beautiful ways to step out of the winter stupor This is an especially sensual season in beauty says Guido Palau of Redken who styled several of the shows And the science behind these hair makeup and nails trends all point to what the season of blooming buds is known to excite the art of love and attraction We explain how MORE How Your Beauty Changes With Daylight Savings Trend 1960s Hair Shapes Accessories Seen at Dolce Gabbana Lanvin Louis Vuitton Marc by Marc Jacobs Marc Jacobs Prada Coifed couture stole the spotlight on fashion runways from New York to Milan where kitschy bouffant shapes made a modern day appearance It s all about how a Sicilian woman in the 1960s would just quickly pin her hair up and tie on a scarf said Guido lead stylist for Redken at Dolce Gabbana At Marc Jacobs and Prada the scarf was tossed in favor of ornate renditions incorporating braids and ponytails Read More The nutrients associated with reproductive health are needed in abundance to produce a lush head of hair From Cleopatra s heavy headdresses to Marie Antoinette s 17th century bigwigs to the modern American Texas woman women have long blasted the fertility message through big hair There s a saying that the higher the hair the closer to God along with being a popular drag queen punch line it s actually quite an accurate statement on reproductivity QUIZ How Healthy is Your Hair Trend 3 D Nail Art Seen at Binetti Joy Cioci the Blonds The beauty world s obsession with all things nail art continued this spring as designs leaped off the nail bed to form intricately imagined three dimensional designs Micro beads and small pearls mimicked bubbles at Joy Cioci and the same materials were dressed in red to conjure caviar at The Blondes Binetti was the show stopper where CND manicurist Heather Reynosa Davis stacked pearls between three layers of press on nails to create a tier of oyster shells You won t be washing dishes in this design she laughed Read More The manicurist may have been joking but her comment hits the evolutionary nail on the head Our hands and nails reveal the type of labor or lack thereof that we do advertising to the world clues about our lifestyles and social standing The ability to wear an ornate nail design that all but renders hands useless for physical work suggests you have means that makes picking you as a partner a potentially more stable choice for which to bear and raise children with MORE Your Guide to Non Toxic Nail Polish Trend Nude Lips Seen at Lanvin Diesel Alice Olivia Vanessa Bruno J Mendel Rebecca Taylor Nude lips arrived in a spectrum of undertones from the peachy bisque at Alice Olivia done by Sarah Lucero for Stila Cosmetics to the fleshy pink at Lanvin Perhaps alluding to such famously nude lipped Parisian sirens as Catherine Deneuve and Brigitte Bardot lead makeup artist Lucia Pieroni for Cl\\\\u00e9 de Peau said of the look at Vanessa Bruno The bare lip feels very French in that uniquely feminine and effortless way it s pouty and full Read More Yet the science behind the sensuality of a nude lip suggests that it s actually the eyes that are at play One way humans perceive gender is by observing the amount of contrast in the eye area females have more while males have less A nude lip only serves to accentuate that contrast by immediately drawing attention to the eye The potential mate is drawn to the gaze with likely no idea that it was the lip that laid the tracks to visual connection MORE Keep Your Lips Young and Luscious Trend Smoked Out Eyes Seen at Roland Mouret Marc by Marc Jacobs Nicole Miller Smoky eyes usually smolder up into the eye line and crease but this season stormy color slid below the lower lash for a full dimensional look that would have most of us looking like raccoons But Val Garland lead makeup artist for NARS Cosmetics at Roland Mouret says it s more about the tude This eye is for the reckless rebel who is daring but sporty like the girls Herb Ritts would photograph Read More When responding to sexual chemistry experts say our pupils dilate when we re looking at someone we re attracted to so both males and females subconsciously rate large pupils as an attractive quality Flanking the pupil in deeper color from top to bottom with a smoked out makeup technique makes the pupil appear larger perhaps communicating a very bold Shall we get it on MORE The Best Shadows for a Smokey Effect Trend Lustrous Nails Seen at Christian Siriano Rebecca Taylor BCBG Diane von Furstenberg Monique Lhuillier Malandrino Call it the new ballet slipper pink Glimmering nails in healthy looking shades emerged after countless seasons spent in the liquid dark The new nude nail is incandescent with a glowing finish the color may be neutral but these are still nails that get noticed said CND lead manicurist Angi Wingle backstage at Christian Siriano Read More And getting noticed is certainly what it s about Ridge free nails with a transparent touch of pink color indicate a steady flow of blood and nutrients and good health A lustrous coat or two of nude polish amps up these attributes with a glossy finish to boot advertising that the wearer has vigor with a body primed to pass on advantageous reproductive genes MORE Perfect the At Home Mani and Pedi Trend Straight Shiny Strands Seen at Herve Leger Jil Sander Rodarte Carlos Miele Texture s big moment may be on its way out stick straight strands reminiscent of 90s minimalism marched in At Jil Sander they were pulled into a decidedly Gwyneth Paltrow esque pony while a side part added intrigue at Carlos Miele done by Rodney Cutler for Ulta Unless you wake up with straight hair in which case you probably want waves the only way to achieve this smooth finish is with a flat iron said Guido of the look he created at Jil Sander Read More The structure of the strand is at the heart of the reason why so many women pine for straight hair Since the formation lays flat and smooth mirror like shine is reflected off the surface with more brilliance than any other texture Shine in hair is the result of a surplus of attractive nutrients like proteins and straight hair serves to exaggerate and broadcast whatever shine may be present MORE The Best Cuts for Straight Hair Trend Pretty Pastels Seen at Anthony Vaccarello Michael Kors Kate Spade Spring was in full bloom on runways with Monet like strokes of pastel blues and pinks on lids and lips At Kate Spade the shades were paired with downturned strip lashes for a mod Twiggy interpretation while a painterly theme swept Anthony Vaccarello The makeup gives a transparent fluid feeling like a reflection of water on eyes said Est\\\\u00e9e Lauder lead makeup artist Tom Pecheux Read More Radiant skin is a much lusted after trait with good reason Glowing skin implies messages about your youthfulness vibrancy and health since a surplus of vitamins like A C and B keep skin cells turning over at a rate that promotes brightness Pastel makeup colors can have an incandescent effect on skin that copies the effect making it appear as though the warmth of a candle is lighting your eyes and lips MORE Master the Dewy Glow Trend Undone Updos Seen at Vera Wang Marni Valentino Bottega Veneta Donna Karan Chlo\\\\u00e9 Disheveled elegance wasn t an oxymoron this season as pinned up styles captured a casual chic vibe with strands falling gently about A slept in ballerina bun was an approachable complement to prim prints at Bottega Veneta and morphed into a nape of the neck chignon at Marni It s a poetic take on weathered hair said lead stylist Paul Hanlon at Vera Wang where the inspiration for the fabric like texture was a turban Read More Messy texture looks young though not because of its preciousness but rather the thicker hair texture it imitates After about the age of 30 hormones eventually lead to hair loss and thinning which can be accelerated by factors like stress diet and smoking Pulling the hair up gives immediate lift and the fuller shape of a messy texture is reminiscent of the crowning hair of youth MORE Secrets for Amazing Hair Trend Lower Lash Liner Seen at Dolce Gabbana Karen Walker Christopher Kane J Mendel Eyeliner on the lower rim is a seconds only trick that can completely change the mood of a look Definition dominated the eyes at Dolce Gabbana where lead makeup artist Pat McGrath used dark chocolate brown on the bottom lash line to create a strikingly feline eye At Christopher Kane the technique was used to impart what lead NARS makeup artist Lucia Pieroni termed turning the dainty a bit dark by adding black to the bottom rim Read More What deep liner applied right below the eye also does is it emphasizes the contrast against the whites of eyes According to a University of Maryland study it appears humans are the only species that distinguish red or white eye color as an indicator of health and emotion The results showed that those with red eyes were assumed to be sad sick and less attractive than their whiter eyed counterparts who were regarded as healthier and happier Lining your eyes not only looks sensual but it also enhances positive perceptions of your gaze MORE Makeup Must Haves for Gorgeous Eyes Trend Mermaid Hair Seen at Elie Tahari J Mendel Binetti We ve previously called it the new beach wave and have admired its beauty on celebs like Jennifer Lawrence and Jessica Chastain now mermaid hair is making the leap to runway At Elie Tahari Esther Langham for Alterna said the glamorously aquatic look was inspired by a 1950s Palm Springs cocktail party while Orlando Pita for Beauty com using Phyto products said the delicate and feminine waves at J Mendel were achieved with equal parts volumizing spray and a flip of a flat iron Read More The evolutionary psychology behind preference for long hair has shown us that it s an indicator of fertility with natural vitamins like biotin and vitamin E needed to cultivate long hair And since hair grows about six inches a year longer hair reads like a medical history for the past four or so years Is the hair full and thick or thin and damaged In a world without Google or Facebook these types of physical clues helped our ancestors size one another up MORE The Best Bangs For

Retina display A5X processor quad core graphics 5 MP camera on the back similar to iPhone 4S Plus HD 1080p video capture Voice dictation 4G LTE capability meaning very fast download speeds 73 mbps on LTE It can also be used as a wireless hotspot 10 hour battery life 9 hours on 4G 9 4mm thick weighing 1 4lbs Storage capacity 16 32 64 GB Technology giant Apple unveiled a new range of iPads 3rd Gen that it said will take tablet computers to a whole new level The computer will have higher resolution than ever before a video recorder and a five megapixel camera with auto focus and auto exposure It will also have voice dictation which allows people to dictate straight to their computer rather than type Apple said the retina display which uses 3 1 million pixels on the 9 7 inch display screen would have the highest resolution display ever on a mobile device Another feature is a high speed 4G wireless network which will allow users to download pictures and films quicker than before Speaking via a video link from California the company s CEO Tim Cook said It is amazing we re taking it to a whole new level The tablet which weighs 1 4lbs will go on sale in the UK on March 16 for between 399 and 659 Cook said We think that iPad is the poster child of the post PC world The momentum behind iPad has been incredible and surprised nearly everyone He also said the device was showing up everywhere in the daily life of people in their work life in their play life all around the world He added Everyone s been wondering who will come out with the product that is more amazing than the iPad2 well stop wondering We are Apple s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller said the retina display technology would mean users would see graphics and text sharper than you could imagine Just beautiful Journalists at the event were shown examples of apps developed for the new iPad which will have a 10 hour battery life including photo editing software and games that use its enhanced display Cook said gorgeous and groundbreaking apps being developed for it would lead to more people using the iPad and in turn lead to more apps being developed He added that 2012 would see a lot more of this kind of innovation we are just getting started Apple also announced that the price of the iPad 2 would fall to between 329 and 429 after the launch of the new device Cook said it would mean more people can afford to get into this ground breaking device Ernest Doku tech expert at uSwitch com said the new iPad was streets ahead of its rivals He said With more horsepower under the bonnet an all new 5 megapixel camera and a mind blowing display bringing higher definition images than the TVs in our homes the new iPad certainly wows in the feature stakes The addition of 4G capability is more relevant for the US market at the moment but it shows how much Apple is really future proofing its new tablet History And Beginnings iPads are a range of portable tablet computers designed developed and marketed by Apple inc primarily as a platform for audio visual media including books periodicals movies music games and web content The original or 1st generation of iPads were revealed to the world on 27th January 2010 It was available in 6 versions 16GB with WiFi WiFi 3G 32GB with WiFi WiFi 3G 64GB with WiFi Wi Fi 3G Released for sale in April 2010 the original or 1st generation iPads sold 3 million units in 80 days In 2010 14 8 million iPads were sold worldwide they made up 75 of all tablet pc s sold that year The iPad2 was unveiled on 2nd March 2011 and was released on sale later that month worldwide It is also available in 6 versions the same as the original iPads 16GB with Wi Fi 16GB with Wi Fi 3G 32GB with Wi Fi 32GB with Wi Fi 3G 64GB with Wi Fi 64GB with Wi Fi 3G The 3rd generation iPads were unveiled in the US on March 7th 2012 and went on sale the same month in the UK Why Is The iPad The Best Over Other Tablets If you re thinking about purchasing one of the iPads you ve more than likely already noticed that it s more expensive than nearly all other tablets that are on the market If you don t know much about Apple and the iPad you might be asking yourself What s so great about it Well I m going to tell you it s one of the best tablets on the market at the moment Support When you want to buy a relatively expensive product you want to know that if anything were to happen to it that it would be repaired quickly and without charge right Well this is exactly what you get with Apple Apple is well known to provide an unbeatable customer service so if you buy one of the iPads you can have the peace of mind that if it needed any repairs Apple would gladly help you out Applications This is one of the major things that iPads have over any other tablet the number applications available There are so many applications on the App Store you ll be spoiled for choice Other tablets may have a few thousand apps available but the App store has many many more There s literally an app for just about anything that you can think of Design I don t think any other tablet can compete with iPads in relation to its design or looks The design is slim and stylish while still feeling strong while you re holding it Performance Since the new iPad3 has a quad A5X core processor there s no need to worry about whether it can handle running several applications at once As well as having a faster processor with more cores than the iPad2 it also has twice as much RAM so if you ever used the original or 2nd generation iPads and thought they were fast you re in for a great surprise when you get your hands on one of the new 3rd generation iPads Software Personally I think that iOS the operating system that runs on iPads is one of the best operating systems that s available today There are so many added features compared to older iOS software As well as this Apple are constantly coming up with new ideas of how they can improve the operating system so you ll always have something to look forward to if you buy one of the new iPads Battery Life You can get roughly ten hours of battery life from all of the iPads which is very good for a tablet This means that most people can get days and days of use without the need to charge it Two Cameras Very few tablets have two cameras especially cameras that take a decent picture too The 2nd 3rg generation iPads have both of these features the camera at the front is also great for chatting to friends and family online Top uses for an iPad You can do just about anything on iPads The days where you needed a laptop an mp3 player and a console to play your games on is long gone Once you have one you can do nearly anything that you want If you re asking yourself whether it s worth it to purchase since you re not too sure what you d actually use it for here are some things that you could use it for Music If you love music it could be the perfect gadget for you Some people don t really think of it as a music player but it s one of the best ones around Think about it since it s made by Apple you have access to the iTunes Store which will allow you to buy basically any song that s out as well as not needing to buy any speakers to play your music on since they already have built in speakers which are very loud for the size of the device If you ve ever used an iPod before in the past you ll know how easy it is to create playlists play songs by a particular artist and so on It s the exact same case with these Games There are thousands upon thousands of games that have been specifically made for iPads No matter what type of games you like you can be sure that you ll find it By using the App Store you can download a wide variety of different type of games whether they re free games or games that you have to pay for Another bonus is that many games that are popular on consoles such as the Nintendo Ds are available on the App Store but at a much cheaper price Online Browsing No matter what you love doing on the internet the iPads have got you covered If you spend loads of time on Youtube you can use the Youtube app to watch all the videos that you want if you want to go on any website that s on the internet you can use Safari to go to it if you constantly check your email address for new emails you can use the Mail app to always know if you ve got an email or not Reading Books Many people also use their iPads as a way to read the latest books With iBooks which comes pre installed on your device on the latest iOS you can read books just like you would with normally by flicking pages to go to the next page etc There are a lot of books which are completely free to download as well as some books that you ll need to pay for to read What makes it so much better than other e book readers is that you can do multiple tasks at once For example while you re reading a book you can listen to any song Are they worth the money There are so many people who ask whether purchasing an iPad is worth the money that Apple charge for them but how can you decide It obviously depends on how much use that you ll get from it but in my opinion I think that they are worth the money Some people assume that because they are seen as an expensive gadget to buy it s not worth the money but this couldn t be any further from the truth Anyway I m going to mention some of the reasons why I think it s worth spending that little bit extra on this amazing bit of technology Travel If you travel a lot getting one of the iPads could be a good idea for you You might be thinking to yourself that you already have a laptop so why bother getting another gadget so you can browse the web But it s simple really there s no hassle carrying one around all day long since they are so light where as laptops can be quite heavy especially if you re carrying it around all day If you just use your laptop or desktop computer to check emails read the news online and so on I d seriously recommend that you think about getting one it just makes life so much easier Quality The quality of the products are great That s one of the main reasons why Apple put a high price tag on their products since they want to make sure that it ll last a relatively long period of time Other gadgets may seem cheap but there s a good chance that it s a false economy since you ll more than likely have a problem or two with them over the following year or two With iPads though you can be nearly certain that nothing will happen to your device and if it does Apple are known to actually care about their customers unlike most other large brands Easy Access To Wireless There has never been a device on the market before which makes it so easy to access wireless networks wherever you are Take this for an example you re in a hotel and want to use their wireless connection to check your emails You have two choices either set up your laptop which takes a couple of minutes mess about with connection settings to get in to the wireless network etc Or you could just tap the mail icon and check your emails straight away I know which one I d choose 3G If you have one of the 3G iPads you can go online no matter where you are This means that you can go online when you re in the car on the train or even while you re out shopping for example New iOS 5 Update What s New Apples newest software release has recently been released It s been called one of the best updates so far but what can you expect from it Well there are loads of new added features some of which are obvious once you install the new update but there are also some new things that most people probably haven t even noticed after having iOS5 on their device for a number of months So here are some things that you can look forward to seeing in the new operating system for iPads iCloud I ll start off with one of the biggest changes that Apple has ever implemented so far Within the last couple of months you may of heard people talking about storing files in the cloud If you aren t sure what this means it s basically a way of storing files ranging from music to word documents so that you can have access to them wherever you are So let s say that you are on holiday and want to check one of your documents you ll be able to do that on any laptop iCloud is the same except it s built specifically for Apple devices Every user gets 5GB storage free of charge and if you need more it s around 20 per year Notification Centre Notification centre is a new way of checking on things that you may have not noticed It lists messages that haven t been read yet application notifications such as a message on Facebook and more You can access notification centre by sliding your finger from the top of your device down to the bottom of your device Syncing Syncing is now much easier on iOS5 you can now sync your music pictures etc without the need of connecting to your laptop Macbook and so on You can do all of this wirelessly now which saves a lot of time iMessage iMessage allows all iOS5 users to message each other over the internet at no cost This is really useful if you have one of the 3G or 4G models since you ll be able to message people no matter where you are It s really simple too just go to the messages app and choose who you want to send a message to Twitter Twitter is now a lot easier to use on your iDevice There s no need to launch Safari or any other browser to go on Twitter since it s now built in to the operating system This makes it much easier to send messages to all of your friends on Twitter Camera Changes There have been a few changes made to the camera in Apples new software update One of the most noticeable differences is that you can go straight to the camera without needing to unlock your lock screen and then tapping on the camera app This ensures that you ll never miss out on a special moment again That s some of the new improvements that have been made in iOS5 for the iPads there are plenty more but these are some of the most important changes which Apple have made live feeds showing cheapest prices for apple ipad 2 & new ipad 3 available from major uk retailers.

2009 4 20 PM I live in Eastern Oregon so my fresh produce isn t nearly as expensive since the stuff is grown locally and not shipped so I understand where the author is coming from At the same time I think she didn t consider those who are not blessed with an abundance of local farmers I am sure if you purchase durring the growing season you can find some great deals too For example for me cantalope is 99c lb because it s winter spring but I know come summer it will be down to 29c lb or less Posted by country girl on April 16 2009 8 35 AM I just paid 1 88 for cantaloupe at Sam s I live

As with all things though it is best to check ads and compare prices Farmers markets and people with roadside stands should have low prices with fresh fruits and vegetables Posted by Michelle on July 12 2009 12 20 AM I don t know where you live but in Massachusetts you are off by 20 to 100 on the cost of fruit and vegetables And I m a very frugal shopper I remember when apples were 10 cents a pound but I haven t seen any under about 1 49 a pound in a long time Even healthfood stores with open bins are 1 00 a pound or more for oatmeal These things aren t the cheap staples they used to be Potatoes under 99 cents a pound Where The US is becoming more like Europe in that we no longer have the cheap food that was available as we grew up We used to have many small farms competing for local business we now have fewer but larger corporate farms subsidized by the federal government elected with the financial support of those same corporations with a huge transportation cost added to the price of food So it goes Posted by euonymous South of Boston MA on July 28 2009 2 32 PM I agree with much of the listed things I disagree with some of them because of where they might be from produced There is a wonderful movement in the USA to eliminate LAWNS and plant EDIBLES one of which is nourishmeant org It is a great idea to replant your place with edibles Foraging is also coming back as a lost art Skip the chemically induced foods by all means of course Here in Alaska we eat a lot of salmon that we catch or dipnet and other seafoods wild berries spruce tips fiddlehead ferns etc I believe that you can find food without purchasing it anywhere you live if you do some research Both my father and grandfather taught us this as a way to live in North Carolina Posted by Cortez Williams RN on July 29 2009 7 37 PM I would like to hear from those who are interested in foraging and other things such as the movement to put a label on Hot Dogs as on example There is some movement to make them labeled as carcinogenic due to their addition of sodium benzoate If this is passes in Legislation how many other products will also have to wear the label Very curious idea Email me at mcortezwilliams at yahoo dot com Only serious need inquire and not about Palin s last day giving hotdogs out Posted by mcortezwilliams on July 29 2009 11 35 PM Ah not to mention Quinoa far more protein and much more delicious than rice Dare to say it but Costco has an organic huge bag for little money and it goes a long way It is a mainstay in our diet over rice cheaper in the long run when you are getting your needed protein Plus you can add to it anything you wish such as fire roasted peppers garlic veggies etc A lovely nutty addition to any household that even the choosiest participant might enjoy Posted by Cortez Williams RN on July 30 2009 12 57 AM I live in rural Nebraska and the stores carry junk produce here Cantalope are 4 99 a piece as well as most fruit and produce trucked in We have Wal Mart here but I DO NOT support it at all I support my local farmers Fruit is terrible here also I myself grow most of my own vegetables in my very tiny yard I practice edible lawn and also homestead in the city and have extra to can or freeze I also dehydrate veggies and fruit I buy from our farmer s market the things that I do not grow myself or did not do well this spring and summer I am on SSI and eat quite well and barter veggies for meat I am a veggie but my elderly parents are not Just because I m in Agricultural Nebraska doesn t mean you get great things also By the way we grow cattle here but it is sooo expensive even here people like me cannot afford it It is shipped out over seas Posted by anonymous on August 03 2009 11 09 AM When fruit at the grocery store gets expensive and flavorless I keep frozen fruit from sam s on hand and use what I need and store the rest until I need it Less wasted that way because it doesn t spoil Also I buy fruit on sale and freeze some of it Frozen bananas make great smoothies Posted by anonymous on August 04 2009 4 01 PM I live on the border of Detroit With nine on our family I have always been frugal Very rarely do I buy produce in a grocery store Instead I find it much cheaper at produce markets The one that I shop at the most runs crazy sales on Wednesdays so much so that the lines wrap around the store I found out that they restock everything on Thursday so I go then The produce is very fresh and there are often further mark downs on some items This week I found three cantalopes for a dollar if I wanted honey rock melons they were four for a dollar Huge green peppers are four for a dollar and the red ones are three for a dollar I always fill my cart and it runs me from 20 this week to 30 dollars last week Posted by Lori on August 31 2009 2 40 PM I ve thrown out most of what I bought at Grocery Outlet in Vallejo The sell by dates are misleading In August I bought sell by Oct 2009 products that were gross old tasting and inedible I don t throw out food I m Zero Waste I threw out most of what I bought there wouldn t even give those old stale Town House crackers or Dobake sliced loaf cake to the birds Don t waste your money at Grocery Outlet Buy retail or at Farmer s Markets and stay healthy Posted by max green on September 17 2009 3 56 PM I have never heard of Quinoa What does it look like How do you eat it We aren t near a Costco but I m sure if I knew what I was looking for I d find it Thanks for the post Ah not to mention Quinoa far more protein and much more delicious than rice Dare to say it but Costco has an organic huge bag for little money and it goes a long way It is a mainstay in our diet over rice cheaper in the long run when you are getting your needed protein Plus you can add to it anything you wish such as fire roasted peppers garlic veggies etc A lovely nutty addition to any household that even the choosiest participant might enjoy Posted

       "  u'{title:First Aid quiz Quiz Quizzes Tools first aid quiz - quizzes - quizzes & tools - health & wellbeing,body:by Dr Frank McLeod If you were to find yourself in an emergency would you know what to do Test your first aid knowledge on our 10 emergency scenarios Published 03 09 2009 1 What should you do if the person next to you suddenly makes a strange sound then falls to the ground unconscious lying stiffly on their back for a few seconds before beginning to jerk their arms and legs violently Your Answer Answer b Remove any objects they may hurt themselves on and roll them on to their side First aid steps Remove any objects they may hurt themselves on Roll them onto their side Clear their airway mouth and throat making sure they can breathe Place them in the recovery position Call an ambulance if the seizure lasts for more than five minutes occurs again soon afterwards or if there is no one to look after the person This scenario describes a grand mal or tonic clonic seizure which occurs most commonly in people with epilepsy Most seizures only last a matter of minutes and are caused by an abnormal burst of electrical activity in the brain After the warning cry which may not always occur the person s trunk and limb muscles become rigid They may grunt or froth at the mouth and possibly urinate The person s face may turn blue but this will sort itself out as soon as the seizure subsides After a moment the person will begin jerking their arms and legs violently convulsing for a few seconds to several minutes When someone is having a seizure the most important thing you can do is ensure they don t breathe in any vomit or injure themselves while they are convulsing You can protect the person by placing them in the recovery position To place someone in the recovery position lie the person on their side tilted slightly forward Arrange their lower arm the one on the ground straight out from the shoulder and pull the leg on the same side straight down Bend the other arm at the elbow and place the hand under the cheek Bend the leg on this side at the hip and knee which will hold them in position Most epileptics don t need to go to hospital for a seizure However ring 000 for an ambulance if the seizure goes on for more than five minutes is followed by another seizure soon afterwards or there is no one who can look after the person for a couple of hours Read our Epilepsy fact file for more information Next question 2 You see a middle aged man suddenly become distressed He appears to be choking and points to his throat He cannot speak and is becoming bluish in colour What should you do Your Answer Answer d Ask him to bend forward and give him a series of hard thumps to his upper back First aid steps Bend the person forward and give them a series of firm thumps between the shoulder blades If the person still can t breathe keep them bent forward and supporting their back with one hand perform strong sudden chest compressions with the other hand Don t try the abdominal thrust Heimlich manoeuvre it s no longer recommended for this type of emergency If a person inhales a piece of food into their voice box larynx they will be unable to speak or breathe in adequately and won t be able to take in enough air to cough and clear their larynx This situation occurs more commonly in young children and older people with dentures If you are with someone and they start choking you should bend the person forward and give them up to five sharp thumps between their shoulder blades Don t be gentle give a good whack using the heel of your hand If the person still can t breathe keep them bent forward supporting their back with one hand Place your other hand over their breast bone and compress their chest five times Use the same force but a slower rate as those used for cardiopulmonary resuscitation If a child one year or older is choking treat them the same way as an adult but decrease the force of your thumps If a baby is choking drape it along your forearm Your arm should be between the baby s legs and your hand under the upper body Again modify the force of your thumps according to the size of the child Don t use the Heimlich manoeuvre it s no longer recommended by first aid authorities Next question 3 You are a member of a search party and have found the missing person who has been lost overnight in the mountains in winter The person is inadequately dressed and very wet What should you do Your Answer Answer c Protect him from the wind remove his wet clothes dry him and wrap him in blankets and a space blanket as soon as possible First aid steps Move the person out of the wind and rain Remove their wet clothing dry them and wrap them in blankets and a space blanket If necessary use your body to warm them this can be life saving in severe cases If the person is conscious give them a warm drink but not alcohol and heat packs In this situation you should immediately prevent the person from losing any further heat Remove any wet clothes and dry the person to prevent heat loss by evaporation Next wrap the person in blankets a sleeping bag is ideal for this to keep their own body heat in Wrap them in a space blanket if you have one this will keep the warmed air locked into the blankets and reduce radiant heat loss You can also use your own body heat to warm the person up to do this remove your clothing so that your skin is in direct contact with theirs then cover both of you with blankets sleep bags etc After you have wrapped them up sit the person in a comfortable position and try to actively warm them up You can give them a warm drink but don t give them alcohol it increases heat loss from the skin You can apply heat packs and hot water bottles to the neck armpits and groins where large blood vessels are close to the surface but take care not to burn them If someone is severely affected by a drop in their body temperature called hypothermia they may have a very slow even undetectable pulse and be unconscious These people should be treated with great care Follow the above steps to prevent further heat loss then keep them horizontal with minimal movement while you transport them to hospital Next question 4 Your partner accidentally places their hand on a hot stove top and burns themselves What s the best thing to do Your Answer Answer b Hold the hand under cold running water for up to 20 minutes First aid steps Place the burned area under cool running water for up to 20 minutes to stop further heat injury Seek medical help especially for burns in children burns with blistering or charring or burns that extend over a wide area If significant blistering or charring has occurred carefully cover the burn using cling wrap or aluminium foil to prepare them for transport to medical care Do not use cotton wool cloth and fibre based dressings or antiseptics and ointments unless advised to by a medic When someone burns themselves the first thing you need to do is reduce the heat in the tissues to stop further damage from occurring You can do this by cooling the burned tissue under cold running water The severity of a burn is determined by the size of the burn and the depth of damage to the skin that occurs There are three levels Reddening the burn causes pain and reddening of the skin Blistering in addition to pain and reddening the burn causes blistering Destruction burns of this group go through the full thickness of the skin and result in tissue death Usually the most severely burned areas are not painful to touch because the nerve endings in the skin are dead If someone has a burn with extensive blistering or any skin death they should be medically assessed When in doubt especially with children see a doctor Severe local burns to the face and hands even if small can have severe long term consequences and must be taken seriously Don t apply anything to the burn most readily available treatments do more harm than good To cover a burn for transport to medical care use plastic cling wrap or aluminium foil applied directly to the burn If blistering occurs don t break the blisters as these act as sterile dressings Next question 5 You come across a car accident and the driver is still in her seatbelt crying in pain and holding her neck She complains of tingling in her fingers and toes What should you do Your Answer Answer a Reassure her ask her to keep still and support her head from behind First aid steps Encourage the person to keep still and support their head and neck against the headrest if there isn t one use clothing or another support Whenever possible let experts get the person out of the vehicle Remember to ensure your own safety at all times If a person has a neck injury with symptoms like tingling in the hands and or feet this could mean they have spinal cord damage In the neck the spinal cord is tightly confined by the bones of the vertebrae relatively minor displacements of these bones can tear or squash the spinal cord and potentially cause paralysis from the neck down quadriplegia It s always better to let the experts work out the severity of the injury Keep the person in place and as still as possible until professional help arrives Use available supports such as clothing or pillows on either side of the person s neck to hold their head in place on the headrest If the car doesn t have a headrest place a support behind their head Loosen any tight clothing keep them as calm as possible and make sure they stay warm If the person is unconscious and having problems breathing your first priority is to clear their airway of any obstruction e g their tongue This might require moving the person from the vehicle Remember to watch out for passing traffic Always support their head and neck and place them in the recovery position Next question 6 What do you do if a child has fallen from their bike hit their head on the ground and is lying unconscious on the ground Your Answer Answer c Check and if necessary clear their airway then place them in the recovery position First aid steps Make sure the child can breathe properly by clearing any obstruction from their mouth Place the child in the recovery position If the child recovers quickly and sits up take them to hospital If the child is still unconscious and not responding to their surroundings call an ambulance to take them to the nearest accident and emergency centre Regardless of age anyone who sustains a head injury and loses consciousness should be taken to hospital Once there they should be observed for a minimum of four hours If you follow this rule a person who is bleeding inside the skull will not be overlooked In these rare but serious cases the person quickly regains consciousness then over a period of minutes to hours begins to deteriorate These people require urgent and expert surgery to save their lives Next question 7 You have been chiselling rust off some steel and feel something go into your eye On looking closely you can see a tiny spot on the clear part of the eye the cornea that covers the pupil and iris What should you do Your Answer Answer d Get professional help to remove the particle First aid steps As soon as possible see an optometrist who will inspect your eye remove the foreign body and if necessary refer you to an ophthalmic surgeon A foreign body on or in your cornea should only be removed by trained personnel If you can t get to an optometrist then go to your local Accident and Emergency department If you are hammering or grinding a surface with an electric grinder steel particles can fly off at very high speed If you re not wearing protection these tiny bits of metal can easily strike your eye and penetrate deep into the eyeball without much obvious external sign of damage If these metallic particles are not removed your eye can become severely inflamed and you run the risk of eventually losing your sight or even your eye If not removed from the cornea you will see a rust ring form at the site which can impair your vision Foreign bodies in your cornea can cause intense irritation Your eye will water profusely and you will have difficulty keeping it open because of light sensitivity that results from the irritation High speed eye injuries like this are best assessed by ophthalmic surgeons and optometrists who will examine the eye with a modified microscope Usually getting in to see an optometrist is easier and quicker than getting an appointment to see an eye specialist If necessary the optometrist will arrange an urgent referral to an ophthalmologist eye surgeon Foreign bodies in the eye that aren t in the cornea can often be removed with a moistened cotton bud Pull the eyelid away from the eyeball and wipe gently inside the eyelid If you have any difficulty see your GP Next question 8 Someone you know who is a diabetic and takes insulin starts to become confused slur their words and stagger as they walk What should you do Your Answer Answer c Give them a sweetened drink such as orange juice with added sugar First aid steps If a diabetic person is confused always treat this as a low sugar emergency Immediately give them a sweetened drink If someone with diabetes has low blood sugar their functioning can be affected very quickly These episodes are most common in diabetics who require insulin which includes all type 1 and some type 2 diabetics but also those only on tablet medication particularly the elderly Early signs of low blood sugar include stumbling for words irritability confusion and even appearing drunk More serious signs include collapsing into unconsciousness Alcohol can make this happen faster If a conscious diabetic person has any symptoms that suggest they have low blood sugar you can never harm them by giving sugar in any form If they don t show some improvement within 10 15 minutes of having some sugar then take them to a hospital either by private transport or ambulance If the person is unconscious do NOT attempt to give them anything by mouth Call 000 to get professional help from ambulance personnel It is possible that this person may be unwell because of a very high blood sugar level due to poor control of their diabetes There is no effective first aid for a person in a high sugar diabetic coma They require medical assessment as soon as possible the longer this situation continues the more serious it becomes The person requires accurate diagnosis and intravenous fluids along with insulin therapy Next question 9 You are with a three year old girl who has a runny nose cough and a high fever She suddenly loses consciousness goes stiff and begins to shake and jerk violently What do you do Your Answer Answer a Place her in the recovery position and protect her from injury First aid steps Put the child in the recovery position to protect her airway Gently restrain the child to protect her from accidentally harming herself during the jerking phase of the seizure Once the seizure subsides and the child is alert enough you can treat the symptoms of the fever It can be frightening to see a child have a fever induced seizure but the best thing you can do is remain quiet calm and put the child in the recovery position Fits associated with a sudden rise in temperature generally don t last long and are quite common After the seizure subsides usually after a couple of minutes the child will probably be confused and not fully aware of his or her surroundings This is normal If the child is sufficiently awake to follow instructions give her the correct dose of paracetamol for her age and weight Remove the child s clothing and if you have a fan place it on low speed to blow air across the child Rapidly cooling a child in a cool bath can make them shiver which generates more body heat and can delay cooling or raise their temperature even further Children under eight years of age will average eight to 12 illnesses per year associated with fever and the vast majority of these will be viral infections that require you to only treat the symptoms While most seizures associated with fevers in children prove to be more distressing than important you should take your child to a doctor as soon as possible after the event If your child is under 12 months of age particularly if their fever is over 39 C seek medical assessment urgently their fever may be an indicator of a more significant infection Next question 10 What do you do if a person suddenly collapses in front of you Your Answer Answer b Try to get a response out of them before checking their airway First aid steps This is the classic situation where you should use the St John Ambulance DRABCD first aid protocol D check for danger in the surroundings both to the victim and you You may need to move the person to a safe area before proceeding R check for a response by calling to the person or giving them a gentle shake A If there is no response check their airway is clear B check that the person is breathing if not turn them on their back and give them two breaths of expired air If their breathing starts up again place them in the recovery position In either case ring 000 If there are no signs of life as in spontaneous breathing and or some response to your efforts then start CPR Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation C You have already given them two breaths so now start giving them chest compressions Push the breastbone down by one third of the thickness of the chest at a rate of about 100 compressions per minute for an adult almost two compressions second Once you have given 30 chest compressions give them two breaths and start again D If there are still no signs of life and a defibrillation device is available use it by following the instructions spoken by the machine many licensed clubs and other venues now have automatic defibrillators throughout their buildings Continue assisting the person until the ambulance arrives and takes over This is a VERY tiring exercise and it is unlikely that you will be able to keep this up for much longer than 5 10 minutes Get others to help you it will make a big difference to this type of resuscitation The most important thing to do is keep the compressions going until help arrives even if you aren t comfortable doing the resuscitation breathing if you were to find yourself in an emergency situation, would you know what to do? test your first aid knowledge on our 10 emergency scenarios. abc health, abc health & wellbeing, health & wellbeing, healthy

or Twitter Photographs J Kenji Lopez Alt The Food Lab s all about clearing up culinary misinformation separating the old wives tales from the old wives that keep telling them So here are the six most common and egregious food myths I commonly encounter and the truth behind them You can use this information to either improve your cooking or to sound like a pompous windbag at your next cocktail party 1 Moist Cooking Methods Give you Moister Results Than Dry Cooking Methods It makes sense right Cook meat in a moist environment braise it boil it simmer it steam it and you ll end up with meat that s moisture if you cook it in a dry environment roast saute grill barbecue broil or fry Unfortunately it doesn t work that way The amount of moisture that a piece of meat retains is pretty much only related to the temperature it is cooked to Basically under a microscope a hunk of meat looks like a bunch of liquid filled straws bound together into bundles The straws are filled to capacity with liquid when the meat is raw As it cooks the walls of those straws contract squeezing liquid out of them whether or not they are in a moist or dry environment It s easiest to think of it as squeezing out a tube of toothpaste Whether you do it in the air or under water just as much toothpaste gets squeezed out You can boil a steak until it s dry just as easily as you can roast it until it s dry What does help keep moist on the other hand is brining Soaking raw meat in a salt water solution fundamentally changes the shape of its proteins allowing them to retain more moisture than they re able to naturally Of course the tradeoff is that the extra liquid in the meat also somewhat dilutes its flavor Even easier in fact since the water in a boiling pot has a much higher specific heat capacity than the air in a hot oven does 2 Frying at a Higher Temperature Prevents Food From Absorbing Oil Next to myth number 4 below this is probably the most widely circulated food myth from home cooks and great chefs alike and it s easy to see why There s no denying that frying food at a low temperature say below 300 F or so leads to greasy end results and that upping the temp to 350 F or above will infinitely improve your food s crispness But does greasy tasting necessarily equate to more grease The common explanation is that when you put food in hot oil the pressure exerted by the bubbles of water vapor rapidly leaving the food prevents the oil from entering the food And it seems to make sense But the thing is the vast majority of the oil that gets absorbed into fried foods happens not while it s inside the hot oil but within the first few seconds after it is removed from the oil If you look at a French fry under a microscope here what s happening While it s being fried the water inside the food is rapidly expanding and converting to steam Much of this water escapes leaving small steam filled cavities in the food As soon as the food is removed from the oil it rapidly drops in temperature The steam inside condenses back into water leaving large vacuum filled holes in its structure What comes in to fill those holes The only thing that can the oil on the surface of the food In fact the amount of oil that a piece of food absorbs is directly proportional to the temperature it is cooked at So the sensation of greasiness you get when eating poorly fried food It s the combination of oil and the moisture left on or near the surface of the food that causes that Well fried food should be nearly water free on its surface giving it a cleaner less greasy mouthfeel 3 When Grilling It s Best to Flip Just Once in the Middle Common backyard know how dictates that burgers and steaks should only be flipped once half way through cooking But has anyone ever bothered questioning why we do this Does it actually create a noticeable improvement in the way your meat comes out Turns out the answer is an emphatic no Flipping your meat multiple times produces meat that s noticeably more evenly cooked there s about 40 less overcooked meat in a burger flipped every 15 seconds vs one flipped once browns just as well just don t expect distinct hash marks and to top it all off ends up cooking in about 2 3rds of the time Faster and better You betcha Moral of the story if you see your buddy doing that multiple flip thing don t get on their case They re doing good 4 Searing Locks In Juices This is the oldest one in the book and still gets repeated by many highly respected cookbook authors and chefs to this day It s been conclusively proven false many times including in our own post on How to Cook a Perfect Prime Rib where we found that when roasting a standing roast it in fact lost 1 68 more juice if it was seared before roasting rather than after The same is true for pork roasts steaks hamburgers chicken cutlets you name it On the other hand searing does improve flavor by catalyzing the Maillard browning reactions a series of chemical reactions that rapidly take place when proteins and sugars are heated to around 300 F or so improving the flavor and texture of the dish But in almost all cases it s better to sear the food after it s roasted not at the start 5 Pasta Must Be Cooked in Massive Amounts of Boiling Water Well this one is actually true but only if you are dealing with really fresh as in you rolled it yourself pasta With dried pasta as long as the pasta is completely covered in water it ll cook just fine People cite the fact that a large pot of water will lose less heat than a small pot of water when you add pasta to it but this is in fact not true There is a difference between heat energy and temperature a value based on how much energy a given amount of a given substance holds So it s indeed true that a large pot of water will show a smaller decrease in temperature than a small pot of water but the amount of energy needed to bring that water back up to a boil when you add the pasta to it is exactly the same no matter how much water you have In fact because a small pot loses less energy to the outside environment because of its smaller surface area it will actually return to a boil faster than a large pot of water will Moreover you don t even need to keep the water all that hot Cover your pasta with boiling water bring it back to a boil put a lid on it and remove it from the heat It ll cook just as fast and evenly as a pot that s kept at a rolling boil for the entire duration of cooking plus it ll shave a few pennies off your gas bill 6 Salting Beans During Cooking Will Make Them Tough Most of us have been told at some point in our culinary careers that salting beans will cause them to toughen It s incredible that this little bit of culinary mis wisdom still lingers for it couldn t be further from the truth A simple side by side test can prove to you conclusively that salting beans both the water used to soak them in and the water used to cook them actually tenderizes the skins It s got to do with magnesium and calcium two ions found in the bean skins that help keep the structure of the beans skin intact When you soak the beans in salt water sodium ions end up replacing some of the magnesium and calcium effectively softening the skins Your beans come out creamier better seasoned and have a much smaller likelihood of exploding while cooking Got a suggestion for an upcoming topic

       "  u'{title:Does High Fructose Corn Syrup Have to Be in Everything by Wilton D Alston ,body:by Wilton D Alstonby Wilton D Alston In her recent article on cholesterol Karen De Coster provided information that should be beneficial to anyone interested in staying healthy In this piece I want to address a similar issue The title says it all Why in the name of health do so many foods marketed to the U S public include high fructose corn syrup Even the most cursory search of the many health sites on the Internet yield a veritable cornucopia of negative information about this stuff The Usual Suspect Again Of course the culprit for the presence of high fructose corn syrup HFCS in all sweetened foods in the U S is the state The mechanism is the incredibly high tariff on sugar produced in other countries The U S government would rather force manufacturers to use inferior and hazardous high fructose corn syrup which can be created from corn a crop grown in the U S than allow them to use more natural sugar from places that seem rather obvious I dont know about you but when I think of sugar I think of sugar cane in South America but when the USDA thinks of sugar apparently they think of cornfields in Nebraska But Really Who Cares What if corn sweetener is just as good as sugar from cane in South America Wouldnt it make sense to support our local producers Well no not with legislation If corn sweetener were really better than cane sugar legislation artificially inflating our price for cane sugar would not be needed Read that sentence again because that is about the size of it Whenever the state gets involved to force the market to take a particular path it is only because the path chosen by the state would not otherwise be taken by anyone intelligent enough to decide on his own Period On the other hand what if corn sweetener is not just as good as sugar from cane Well Houston then we have a problem According to experts such as Mehmet Oz and Michael Roisen high fructose corn syrup is a horrible sweetener In their landmark book You The Owners Manual they state One of the biggest evil influences on our diet is the presence of high fructose corn syrup HFCS a sugar substitute that itself is a sugar found in soft drinks and many other sweet processed foods The problem is that HCFS inhibits leptin secretion so you never get the message that youre full And it never shuts off gherin so even though you have food in your stomach you constantly get the message that youre hungry See page 192 With apologies to the Church Lady Well isnt that special So the state forces us to consume a sweetener thats obviously not as good for us just so their constituents can sell more make more money and vote en bloc for the legislator who visits this evil on the rest of us Sounds like yet another example of misplaced incentives Other Sweeteners Same Problem Those of us who are into health know all about stevia This is a very powerful natural sweetener extracted from South American plants much as sugar is extracted from cane One can find stevia in health food stores but it is not allowed as an ingredient in processed foods Why not The typical statist would say because it is not shown to be proven safe and effective which is FDA speak for because we didnt say you could use it Call me a conspiracy realist but I doubt that safe and effective had much to do with the FDA deciding to ban stevia Nothing drives this point home better than this little tidbit the FDA initially labeled stevia as an unsafe food additive after an anonymous complaint Yes an anonymous complaint You simply cannot make this stuff up But stevia has been used by other cultures for thousands of years with no ill effects Yes thousands of years If its so dangerous why are we in the U S alone on Earth in recognizing the danger In Japan the government will not allow artificial sweeteners in soft drinks so they use stevia instead In fact it accounts for 40 of the Japanese sweetener market In the U S the government wont allow stevia but we get a heaping helping of Aspartame Sucralose and all manner of other chemical junk Where is the logic Maybe I should just follow the money Interestingly many of the sweetening chemicals we re allowed to have as additives come with warning labels by the way so the government considers it established that there are health problems with those Conclusion The decisions we each make about what we eat are some of the most basic ones we ll ever encounter But in the case of HFCS just as one example we in the U S arent given that choice The FDA claims to protect us from snake oil salesmen of every stripe yet when it comes to being able to choose an item of food that is among the most basic and prevalent in any diet economic considerations trump safety From my standpoint while this about par for the course it is still darned unsettling What will it take to reverse the tide January 17 2007 Wilt Alston send him mail lives

decided to walk there from the doctor s office since it was such a nice day we only made it ten blocks but still Heels Sundress A stroll on a lovely September day I say this not to point out how ridiculous I can be because really I believe it points itself out but to outline this thing I do where I get an absurdly ambitious ideal in my head and spend the rest of my time trying to close the gap between the dream and my reality Hm perhaps that didn t make much sense Let me put it in food terms Before I had the baby I attempted to spend some time baking and stashing no not practical things like meals to save us from an endless rotation of diner eggs and takeout pad thai oh please no I made things like treats to woo extra awesome care from labor and delivery nurses and granola bars that our families in the waiting room might enjoy and some date cake we could all enjoy with some fresh baby and coffee the next day Like I said absurd I also imagined that we d have an influx of visitors in the weeks after we took Jacob home and realizing I d have no time to put out my usual spread decided to ambitiously bake some things we could set out as needed like banana bread And lemon cake And scones Except I only got to the scones At least I picked good ones Enter the reality of life with a newborn and sure enough baked goods are the last thing on our minds And of course we d forgotten that these scones were stashed them in the freezer until an unusually calm Sunday this past weekend when two friends came by to meet The Cutest Baby Ever Baked an objective assessment of course especially once tiny elbow patched Fair Isle sweaters are involved on Sunday and I wanted to find something besides wine that is we could snack on The pantry presented me with sorry options wasabi peas stale raisins and half a box of Jelly Belly Sours anyone but there in the freezer were these forgotten scones I baked them still frosty until they were puffed golden and made our apartment smell like a fondue pot that s a good association trust me and even though we were ridiculously overtired and even though the North Fork wine I d been so eagerly anticipating only put me in a coma and even though Jacob managed to shall we say Christen the guest who had the misfortune to witness a diaper change oops and perhaps this wasn t the kind of calm gathering I had pictured in my late pregnancy haze it was delicious and hilarious and I realize now that I wouldn t want it any other way One year ago Molly s Apple Tarte Tatin and Cranberry Walnut Chicken SaladThree years ago Classic Brownies and Winter Squash Soup with Gruyere Croutons Jalape\\\\u00f1o Cheddar SconesAdapted Peter Oleyer at Calexico Carne Asada in Brooklyn via NYMag It s worth noting that I had my doubts about this recipe This world is overflowing with terrible scones and after trying too many bad ones I came to the conclusion that the only good scones the only ones you should bother making or eating ever are these dreamy cream ones However this recipe manages to be different it contains eggs and yet is still delicious but considering the possibility that there are two good scone recipes on earth makes my sleepy head hurt thus I will reconcile this another time For now know that these are good very good 2 cups all purpose flour1 tablespoon baking powder1 teaspoon salt8 tablespoons 1 stick or 4 ounces cold butter diced1 2 cup heavy cream3 eggs divided1 4 pound sharp Cheddar cheese diced2 small jalape\\\\u00f1os pepper minced I wimped out and used only one only to find my scones entirely heat free Preheat oven to 400 F In a small skillet melt 1 2 tablespoon of butter and saut\\\\u00e9 the jalape\\\\u00f1os in it until soft about two minutes Let them cool then place them in a small bowl with the cheddar cheese and coat them with one tablespoon of the flour Combine the remaining flour with the baking powder and salt Cut in the remaining butter with a pastry blender fork or two knives until the butter bits are pea sized Lightly whip two of the eggs and cream and add to the flour butter mixture Using a wooden spoon fold mixture until it begins to come together Add the cheddar jalape\\\\u00f1o mixture to the dough and mix until everything is incorporated Turn out the dough onto a well floured surface and knead gently for less than one minute Pat dough out to a 3 4 to 1 inch thickness and either cut into 8 triangles or the shape of your choice with a biscuit cutter Make an egg wash by beating the remaining egg with a teaspoon of water Brush the scones with egg wash and place on a

       "  u'{title:Metformin Reduce Blood Sugar Levels ,body:Metformin is the diabetes treatment proven to reduce blood sugar levelsimprove the body s use of insulin and be a targeted type 2 diabetes treatment Metformin ingredients work to reduce the amount of glucose produced by our livers and the amount of glucose absorbed through the stomach More than this the actions of Metformin and cholesterol reduction go hand in hand it actively prevents low density lipoproteins or bad cholesterol from attaching to arteries and blood platelets Metformin ingredients are particularly effective as a type 2 diabetes treatment the common adult onset form of diabetes With its ability to reduce blood sugar levels Metformin curbs the cravings for sugar and in doing so becomes a useful dieting aid A valuable weapon in combating the effects of ageing metformin addresses the natural loss of glucose tolerance with age and the linked cardiovascular diseases and the Metformin and cholesterol regulating properties make it a comprehensive wellbeing and diabetes treatment How does Insulin help in reducing glucose in the body Insulin is vital to reduce the amount of glucose in the blood It s the hormone produced by the pancreas that reduces the glucose levels produced by our liver Insulin is also instrumental in removing glucose from the blood by muscle and fat tissues which burn glucose for energy When this level of insulin depletes and the amount produced slows down diabetes occurs This is when it s necessary to seek an effective diabetes treatment It s very common for people past middle age to experience a loss of glucose tolerance and the effects are significant Unlike glucose lowering drugs which fall into the sulfonylurea class those drugs which are specifically designed to manage type 2 diabetes such as Glyburide Micronase Diabeta or Glipizide Glucotrol Metformin does not increase the level of insulin in the blood and as a result cause excessively low blood glucose levels What s special about the Metformin action is that it doesn t reduce the availability of glucose in the body and doesn t affect the levels of insulin It acts by making the receptors more sensitive to insulin which means available glucose is utilized more effectively Metformin s action also increases the sensitivity of the hypothalamus and peripheral tissues like muscles to the effects of insulin In effect it rejuvenates this response restoring the effects of glucose and insulin to much younger physiological levels This all means that not only do the physical properties of metformin help with diabetes but the ability of metformin to control sugar cravings is activated Metformin s action also increases the sensitivity of the hypothalamus and peripheral tissues like muscles to the effects of insulin In effect it rejuvenates this response restoring the effects of glucose and insulin to much younger physiological levels Metformin Ingredients and Effects in Diabetes Treatment Metformin was the first drug to be approved by the US FDA in 1994 as a blood sugar reduction treatment Further tests reveal metformin as a versatile drug and by so effectively treating diabetes associated conditions are likely to be reduced Indeed Scientific tests show that using metformin reduces the complications linked to diabetes such as heart disease blindness and kidney disease Why Metformin Works as a Life Extension Drug The simple explanation is that Metformin protects your body by lowering cholesterol and preventing low density lipoproteins bad cholesterol from attaching to blood platelets and arteries The Metformin lower cholesterol level can be achieved and a reduction in the risk of blood clotting Tests in 2002 suggest that it also acts as an antioxidant By stabilizing sugar levels undertaking a Metformin diet is potent in curbing cravings for sugary food especially useful in weight control and encouraging a healthy attitude to eating Diabetes is believed by many gerontologists who study ageing to be an example of accelerated or premature ageing Addressing age related diabetes and the prevention of sugar cravings together with improved body composition insulin use and the stabilization of sugar levels can only help to promote increased longevity What are the ingredients in metformin Primarily it contains metformin hydrochloride the chemical that actively decreases the liver s production of glucose It also includes magnesium stearate emulsifiers and delayed release agents these all help bind the properties of the treatment make it easy to swallow and release the ingredients at the right time in the right amounts Metformin doses and side effects A regular dosage of Metformin for people over 40 years of age is 500mg to 850mg up to three times a day The best diet for metformin as with every supplement and for a sound overall health plan is varied and balanced plenty of fruit and vegetables and low to moderate amounts of foods high in fat and sugar The effect of metformin on low sugar diets is that it helps control cravings for foods high in carbohydrate and sugar so it s actively recommended in this case Metformin also has the ability to help avoid a blood clot possessing properties that help avoid a hardening of the arteries that can in turn lead to a heart attack Metformin also sometimes referred to in the generic glucophage produces minimal side effects which is amply supported in testimonial and is a proven type 2 diabetes treatment with the added ability to lower cholesterol There are very few contraindications but very rarely lactic acidosis can occur in diabetics and taking metfomin in this case has been known to cause panic attacks In those suffering with a hypothyroid condition metformin can help alleviate symptoms In whichever case it s always advisable to ask your doctor before embarking on any course of medication Metformin s power to help lower glucose levels produced by the liver and absorbed from food is key to improving the level of insulin in the body With balanced insulin levels the ability to lower cholesterol and the reduction of cravings for fatty foods all mean that metformin becomes a very potent long term health supplement indeed Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought Frequently Asked Questions About Metformin Disclaimer Please note that only your own physician can determine your precise needs but in order to give you some information these answers are based upon the average person and clinical published results Since weight training does rely on blood glucose for sustained workouts would metformin negatively impact the duration of the workout by reducing the available glucose used for energy Metformin does not reduce the availability of glucose nor does it directly affect its levels nor the levels of insulin It acts by making the receptors more sensitive to insulin which means that glucose levels are better utilised You may like to read Dr Dean s article below for further information http www antiaging systems com articles 116 metformin as a safe effective weight loss drug I am considering adding metformin to my anti aging program and I would like some more information on it before I start putting it into my body I m excited about the possibility that it activates the same gene expression as CR but most important to me is long term safety I understand metformin has a 40 year track record so there must be significant data regarding the safety of long term usage I understand that metformin has to be detoxified by the liver What tests should I have done and which parameters should I pay attention to for my liver function before and during using metformin I m not sure what the implications are for using metformin with regard to minimal fasting blood sugar and fasting insulin levels At my last blood test my fasting serum glucose was 17mg dl range 65 99 and my fasting insulin was 2 4 uU ml range 6 0 27 0 Please advise as I m looking for information but can t find any good sources Dr Dean offered the following advice I think this individual numbers look very good As long as kidney and liver functions SGOT SGPT BUN creatinine are normal he can take Metformin without concern The parameter I watch in those who suffer from impaired liver or kidney function as well as in diabetics is lactic acid This fellow will probably benefit less than someone who had a medical problem It s like putting an athlete on a training program The less fit a person is the more he will benefit from the training program Adding metformin to someone whose parameters are all in the very fit range will not benefit him as much as someone who has deviated significantly from the norm Additional information sources are on the IAS website at http www antiaging systems com 136 metformin metforal http www antiaging systems com approveduses 103 metformin http www antiaging systems com 136 metformin metforal Metformin Dosage For those over 40 years of age one 500mg to 850mg once twice or three times a day Consult your physician if you are a diabetic have any liver or kidney problems or have ever suffered from lactic acidosis Stop use if you feel unwell Metformin Side Effects Rare in healthy aging individuals but may include nausea loss of appetite and very rarely vomiting stomach pain and diarrhea Patients with diabetes type I and II sometimes take doses as high as 3 grams a day in which case side effects may include hypoglycemia or lactic acidosis Recommendation on How to Take Metformin Dosage Metformin can inhibit the uptake of vitamin B12 so a B12 supplement is recommend whilst using Metformin Metformin may be synergistic with Acarbose and Aminoguanidine Use of Metformin is contraindicated when combined with Thiazide Cimetidine diuretics or other anti hypertensive products which could cause renal malfunctioning It is also contraindicated in individuals with ketonuria serious hepatic and renal disorders

- your accredited online degree directory,body:Accidents happen anywhere anytime even when proper safety and training steps are taken Every year thousands of workers file claims after something within the system hiccups and compromises their overall well being or quite simply because the demands of the positions themselves begin wearing down the body with continuous physical stress Injuries which the government lumps in with illnesses run the most rampant in the offices warehouses roads and other workplaces across the United States For consistency s sake all numbers have been culled from the Bureau of Labor Statistic s 2010 study of nonfatal occupational illnesses requiring days away from work Sprains Strains and Tears In 2010 46 9 out of 10 000 workplace related injuries and illnesses came in the form of what the Bureau of Labor Statistics labels sprains strains and tears Forty three percent of these incidents occurred because of workers overexerting themselves with 36 impacting the back Yet such injuries to the shoulders actually required more time away from work than any other body part with an average of 21 days Back sprains strains and tears have actually declined in the previous years and at a rate faster than any other body part no less Musculoskeletal Disorders The BLS lumps all musculoskeletal injuries and illnesses into one statistic and they make up 34 3 out of 10 000 on the job incidents Most complaints involve the back but rotator cuff disorders carpal tunnel and other nonspecified pains are also extremely common All of them have experienced an increase over time especially amongst those working as orderlies nurses and attendants Overexertion Twenty seven out of 10 000 total workplace injuries and illnesses occurred because of overexertion marking an increase of 3 from previous years Social assistance and healthcare positions in the private sector experienced far more strain related conditions at a staggering rate of 48 per 10 000 employees Overexertion in lifting comprised 13 2 of the 27 reported cases and the aforementioned sprains strains and tears stood as the most likely result of pushing the body beyond its limitations General Soreness and Pain Overall body pain including the back accounted for 13 3 out of 10 000 reported on the job injuries and illnesses and 11 required recovery at home or a convalescence center Labor jobs unsurprisingly stood as the riskiest when it comes to suffering the symptoms particularly among workers in transportation and warehousing Twenty eight out of 10 000 of such employees reported severe soreness and pain with a median of 17 days away from the job to properly recover Bruises and Contusions The BLS reports that 9 9 out of every 10 000 workplace injuries involved contusions and bruises and a total median of four days away from work to heal Numbers also reveal that 2 2 out of 10 000 incidents of multiple injuries also involve bruising as well as sprains Once again transportation and warehouse workers experienced the highest rate of suffering the conditions with 20 2 out of 10 000 Cuts Lacerations and Punctures Twenty nine percent of the 9 1 of 10 000 cut laceration and puncture reports involved some sort of incident regarding work related equipment with fingernails and fingers the most vulnerable body bits accounting for 26 At 1 1 of 10 000 Punctures stand as far less common than cuts and lacerations which the BLS lumps together Employees in the refuse and recyclable material collection industry suffered these injuries significantly more than their counterparts elsewhere with a staggering 185 9 out of 10 000 reporting slices and dices Fractures Fractures accounted for 8 5 out of 10 000 reported workplace injuries and illnesses and employees diagnosed with the condition needed a recuperation period of 28 days away from the job The hunting industry claims 21 1 of the 2010 numbers making it the most at risk demographic followed by mining 17 9 and construction 17 7 As a part of the BLS statistics regarding multiple sustained injuries and illnesses it only afflicts 9 out of 10 000 Multiple Injuries and Disorders Workers who experienced more than one diagnosis concurrently form an entire grouping according to the BLS who cited 5 7 instances out of every 10 000 in 2010 Hunting again exists as the most vulnerable career path to sustaining multiple traumatic injuries and illnesses at a rate of 11 3 out of 10 000 and as seen previously instances involving strains and bruises are more common than those with fractures and burns However law enforcement officials were the most likely 33 3 out of 10 000 to require time away from work in order to recuperate Back Pain Four out of 10 000 workplace injuries and illnesses specifically involved some form of back pain whether alone or in conjunction with some other body part Owing to the nature of their positions both intercity and transit bus drivers suffer the most in both categories 96 1 out of 10 000 for combined pain and 44 out of 10 000 for just the back In total though cases hailing from all professions only needed about eight days outside of work for a recovery to take place Heat Burns and Scalds Food service employees at a rate of 8 5 for every 10 000 workers suffer from scalds and heat burns more than their counterparts in any other industry Across the board though these injuries still sported a rate of 1 6 out of 10 000 reported cases of occupational incidents On average burns and scalds required a median of eight days to properly heal enough for patients to safely

       "  u'{title:Donut Muffins with Caramel Filling ,body:Caramel and I were not speaking for a while About a year ago I made Samoa cookies from scratch and instead of using real caramel sauce I melted store bought caramels It was a disaster After spending what seemed like hours of unwrapping each candy and scrapping it out of the saucepan I ended up with a hard pulley mass that tore through the cookie crust like a lawn mower Now I realize that making caramel myself not only tastes 110 better but I won t have to worry about undoing all those years of wearing braces and a retainer When it comes to baking and cooking do we go through phases in the same way teenagers sometimes do Or am I too easily obsessed with things once I figure out how to perfect them Lately I can t seem to get enough caramel I have always been a dark chocolate fan When presented with a choice I ve always gone with fudge over caramel when it comes to sundaes mochas over caramel macchiatos But ever since I became comfortable with making homemade caramel I can t get enough of it Unless I have specific requests I don t make anything more than once These donut muffins are one of the few recipes that I have made several times just due to the fact that I love them so much They are so easy to put together and they really do have the flavour and texture of an actual donut Plus you don t have to worry about messy oil splatters Since this recipe is as comfortable to me as an old pair of jeans I thought it would be perfect to try with my new obsession I cannot imagine what is not to like about a buttery sugar coated donut stuffed with creamy caramel You can use any filling in these muffins I have used chocolate sauce raspberry jam and bananas But I think that the caramel was the clear winner Since I like my caramel on the salty side it pairs perfectly with the sugary muffin During the baking process the caramel sinks through the muffin batter and makes a hole at the bottom This sticky bottom soaks up the butter which in turn is the perfect magnet for the sugar bath Once the muffins have cooled off the edges take on a marvelous crisp shell which protect the soft moist crumb waiting inside Even before you reach the caramel you will be on a cloud of happiness The creamy buttery caramel center just pushes these muffins over the edge and you may not want to share them with anyone except your various personalities Donut Muffins with Caramel Filling Muffin Ingredients recipe adapted from Baking Bites 3 4 cup sugar1 large egg1 1 2 cups all purpose flour2 tsp baking power1 4 tsp salt1 4 tsp ground nutmeg1 4 cup vegetable oil3 4 cup milk or half half1 tsp vanilla extract2 tbsp butter melted1 2 cup sugar for rolling1 4 tsp of ground cinnamonCaramel Sauce Ingredients recipe from Simpy Recipes 1 cup of sugar6 Tbsp butter1 2 tsp of sea salt1 2 cup heavy whipping creamMethod Muffins Preheat oven to 350F Lightly grease a muffin tin with cooking spray or vegetable oil In a large bowl beat together sugar and egg until light in color In a small bowl whisk together flour baking powder salt and nutmeg Pour into egg mixture and stir to combine Pour in vegetable oil milk and vanilla extract Divide batter evenly into 10 muffin cups or 24 mini muffin cups filling each about 3 4 full Take a small spoonful of the caramel sauce recipe follows and let it drip into the top of each muffin Bake for 15 18 minutes for standard sized muffins or 11 12 minutes for mini muffins until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean While muffins are baking melt butter and pour remaining sugar into a small bowl When muffins are done lightly brush the top of each with some melted butter remove from the pan and roll in sugar Cool on a wire rack Caramel First before you begin make sure you have everything ready to go the cream and the butter next to the pan ready to put in Heat sugar on moderately high heat in a heavy bottomed 2 quart or 3 quart saucepan As the sugar begins to melt stir vigorously with a whisk or wooden spoon As soon as the sugar comes to a boil stop stirring You can swirl the pan a bit if you want from this point on Note that this recipe works best if you are using a thick bottomed pan If you find that you end up burning some of the sugar before the rest of it is melted the next time you attempt it add a half cup of water to the sugar at the beginning of the process this will help the sugar to cook more evenly though it will take longer as the water will need to evaporate before the sugar will caramelize As soon as all of the sugar crystals have melted the liquid sugar should be dark amber in color immediately add the butter to the pan Whisk until the butter has melted Once the butter has melted take the pan off the heat Count to three then slowly add the cream and salt to the pan and continue to whisk to incorporate Note than when you add the butter and the cream the mixture will foam up considerably This is why you must use a pan that is at least 2 quarts preferably 3 quarts big Check here for an explanation of why adding the cream makes the mixture bubble up so much Whisk until caramel sauce is smooth Let cool in the pan for a couple minutes then pour into a glass mason jar and let sit to cool to room temperature Remember to use pot holders when handling the jar filled with hot caramel sauce Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks Warm before serving I made the sauce before the muffins I left it in the pan and kept stirring it from time to time to keep it from becoming too hard

and I have been busy in and out of the kitchen preparing for the special day We want our dessert table to be filled not only with traditional Italian Cookies but also mini Italian Desserts Italian Pastries and mini Italian Cakes The sweets need to be made ahead and this Milk Chocolate Panna Cotta is perfect I knew they would be extra special topped with this scrumptious Port Cherry Sauce I plan on serving the Panna Cotta in shot glasses The Port Cherry Sauce will add another flavour dimension but it will also add a striking pop of colour I made them just before heading off to Atlanta for a Food Blogging Conference I don t know about you but I m always run off my feet before heading out of town I wanted to make something special for the kids and my Mom to enjoy for dessert while I was away Panna Cotta is so simple to make and it takes so little time the perfect dessert when time is precious Natalie popped in for a visit while I was away and again last night She mentioned she enjoyed the panna cotta especially the Port Cherry Sauce I think she will be pleasantly surprised when she sees the panna cotta on the dessert table That is if she doesn t see this post ahead of time I m counting on her being very busy with wedding plans leaving little time for reading The week leading up to the shower will be hectic I plan on making Cannoli Siciliani Cannoncini alla Crema Pasticcera mini Torta Caprese mini Hazelnut Raspberry Jam and White Chocolate Tarts mini Triple Chocolate Mousse Cakes and homemade Baci Chocolates We ve had the most terrible time planning the shower if something could go wrong it has Fingers crossed I am hoping our luck will change and that in the end all will go well If you ve never tried Panna Cotta I urge you to give it a try Panna Cotta has a smooth creamy consistency and it s a versatile dessert Add whatever flavourings you fancy the possibilities are endless And the dessert can be topped simply with a dollop of sweetened whipped cream fresh berries or with berry compote caramel chocolate or berry sauce I want to take a moment and thank you all for the well wishes on my upcoming cookbook release This is a very exciting time in My

t help but feel a mix of emotions sorrow for the family who lost their child in such a tragic way and anger because a child\\\\u00e2 s death could have been prevented According to WakeMed Health Hospitals preventable injuries are the number one killer of children ages 14 and under in the United States The North Carolina based healthcare system asserts that \\\\u00e2 90 of these injuries could be prevented if families took the simple steps necessary to protect their children \\\\u00e2 The Center for Disease Control reports that over 12 000 children died during the period of 2000 2006 as a result of an unintentional injury \\\\u00c2 Parents and nannies must work together to create a safe environment for children to explore and interact with their world While all safety risks can\\\\u00e2 t be eliminated they can certainly be minimized to reduce the likelihood of a child becoming victim to a preventable injury Whether you are a parent or a nanny it\\\\u00e2 s vital that you are familiar with preventable injuries and take steps to protect the children in your care Preventable injuries include Crib Suffocation \\\\u00e2 Infants can become suffocated by crib bumpers soft bedding loose blankets and cuddly toys \\\\u00c2 Removing bumpers using a sleep sack and putting the baby to bed with nothing else in the crib can help prevent suffocation Window Falls \\\\u00e2 Children can climb onto windowsills and fall out of open windows Keeping windows closed and locked when not being used for ventilation installing window guards with a quick release system removing

on Thursday September 24th 2009 at 1 32 pm by alexThe Rolex Air King watch fake is one of the best Rolex replica models meant for anybody This is because of its cheaper rate and availability as one of the top best replica watches in the watch world The historical developmentThe Rolex Air King replica has its origin in the historical invention of the original brand also known as the Rolex Air King which was introduced by the Rolex Company in the early days of the year 1931 It came as an offshoot of the mother brand known as the Rolex Oyster perpetual The main Rolex brand however was first of all the creative product of Hans Wilsdorf and Alfred Davis who joined forces in the year 1905 as they blessed the world with a special watch brand which later became known as the Rolex brand They began locally by manufacturing some watches which they termed Wilsdorf and Davis as the brand name Later in 1908 the need for expansion came The brand was therefore registered as a Trademark This feat led to the establishment of the famous Rolex Company As time went on the company produced various models of the Rolex brand In the year 1931 it came up with the wonderful Rolex Air King brand which became the best brand for kings heroes princes and those on the corridors of power The Rolex Air King was therefore very costly because of its position This led to the introduction of the Rolex Air King watch fake mode Today the Rolex Air King watch fake model still maintains all the quality features seen in the original It has wonderful gold and stainless bracelets in its various quality models Finally the Rolex Air King watch fake is a very durable watch model with real second hand value Written on Tuesday September 15th 2009 at 8 53 pm by alexIf you want to start your own website there are quite a few things you have to consider before you do that You have to choose a domain name a website design but you also have to decide where you re going to host your website and who is going to host it for you You can t just run your website from your home computer because home internet connections are not fast enough You should buy hosting from a respected and trusted company Since your website will be hosted with them if their servers go down your website also goes down Therefore you should find a company that guarantees good uptime There are also a ton of tiny web hosting companies out there and some of them can t be trusted so look for reviews of each company before buying hosting from them There are different types of hosting For example shared hosting means you will share that server with other people say 50 other people So if somebody else s website gets a lot of traffic it could slow down your website The advantage to this is the cost for shared hosting is low You can also get dedicated hosting which will cost a lot more but you get full control over the server and nobody else can use it Written on Tuesday September 15th 2009 at 8 43 pm by alexThere are many different reasons why you need to get your Microsoft Certified IT Professional MCITP certification as soon as possible The biggest reason is because you ll be so well trained in the IT field that you re almost guaranteed to find and keep a very good job But you should also do it for yourself to gain new information in a subject you need to know about The easiest and fastest way to get your MCITP certification is to attend the mcitp boot camp Among other things you will learn from professionals who have been working in their respective fields for years You ll learn real world skills and situations not hypothetical situations that will never really happen or help you get a job Your MCITP certification shows that you have been trained and are accomplished in your field of choice like database management or system administrator And you re not just getting information from people who think they know what they re talking about This bootcamp is taught by well respected people who know what they re doing There are a range of different bootcamps to choose from everything from Windows 2008 support expert to CCNA training to server administration to database development database administration and so much more The best part is the way you get to learn You don t actually have to show up for bootcamp in a classroom to take this course although that is an option You can learn on your own time in the comfort of your house on your computer Ever better you can put these training videos in your iPod Touch and watch or listen to them at lunch And if you like the classroom setting take a trip to any one of their campuses and take a classroom course taught by a professional in person ,url:youneed2see web 131 Amazing _ Stumble Upon _pictures_ 4_1_07}',\n",

       "  u'{title:Neapolitan 5 Layer Birthday Cake with Strawberry Frosting ,body:Well hello What an exciting few days it s been Lots going on and as usual no two days have been the same As I mentioned in my last post I was thrilled when Ree The Pioneer Woman chose two of my cake photos for her Food Photo Assignment another one of her wildly popular photo contests It meant so much to me considering I m pretty new at all of this and there were as usual so many amazing entries My blue birthday cake photo ended up winning as a finalist in the competition so I could not be more pleased Coincidentally most of what I learned about photography was from Ree I find her photography tutorials to be particularly helpful down to earth and as always with The Pioneer Woman charming If you d like to take a peek at my blue birthday cake photo and more about the results of the Pioneer Woman Photography Food Photo Assignment you can view it here along with the gorgeous winning photo by Jennifer Glass Speaking of birthday cakes I was in a layer cake kind of mood this week both making and eating of course One of my favourite layer cakes is Neapolitan Cake layers of rich chocolate strawberry and vanilla cake layered with homemade strawberry jam The flavours really work so well together and I personally find it really unique and quite appealing if not striking once sliced What s interesting is that most people know of it and I think really enjoy it yet I don t see it often I made Neapolitan cake for the first time last year for Neve s birthday as part of her Girly Woodland Table if you d like to see more from that Neapolitan dessert table you can view the post here I had the idea to make a Neapolitan Cake based on the colour scheme of her party but wasn t sure what would work for filling I noticed Martha Stewart had done a 3 layer version using jam as filling which I thought was perfect The guests seemed to really enjoy it and I had a lot of fun making it I love when a cake looks pretty traditional and simple on the outside but has an unexpected appearance on the inside No matter how many cakes I make I m always secretly or not so secretly excited and eager to slice it and see what it looks like inside particularly when it s a multi flavoured cake like this one Such anticipation It seems people can t resist peeking over my shoulder with curiousity when I first slice into a cake and this one usually earns an oh wow Kind of crazy looking inside right I love the contrast but most importantly always it is really truly a delight to eat I find you don t really taste the jam filling but it adds a great strawberry flavour and makes the cake even more moist and yummy It tastes so very Neapolitan and to me very reminiscent of my childhood I feel as though even the cake itself with its colour combination has a retro feel to it which I really like This time I went for a sugary pink Strawberry Frosting for more of a fun birthday cake taste and to carry through the strawberry flavour a bit more The possibilities are endless though as you could opt for chocolate frosting ganache filling Swiss meringue buttercream and fondant and more Visually I think I prefer it with a nice chocolate fondant over buttercream but really pink is never a bad idea or rarely at least and this Strawberry Frosting is so delicious I used simple homemade strawberry jam between the layers which I prefer both for taste and look with the Neapolitan Cake It s also very quick and easy to fill that way If you filled it with frosting I feel it might be a bit much since there s already so much going on but that is definitely personal preference and the cake flavours lend to vanilla chocolate or strawberry fillings and frostings If you d like to recreate this one here s what I did 1 Baked my favourite Strawberry Vanilla and Chocolate cake recipes for 9 round pans You can layer any way you like but I chose to torte my chocolate and strawberry 9 round cakes into 2 each and just used one vanilla Each of the 5 layers are about 1 high 2 Using a thin 9 round cake board I placed the first layer down filled with jam and repeated until the cake was stacked I then covered the whole cake in airtight container and placed in fridge for about an hour 3 I made a batch of Strawberry Party Frosting tinted it Strawberry pink using a few drops of AmeriColor Electric Pink I tend to use this brighter version of pink gel often because with buttercream being a yellow tinge it seems to cut right through the yellow making the result a nice bright pink Once the cake was chilled I frosted it added my favourite white sprinkles and then piped a classic birthday cake star tip border and shell border on the bottom using a Wilton Open Star Tip 22 for both You can use your favourite Chocolate and Vanilla recipe or you can use my favourites links attached I ve included a recipe for Strawberry Cake since it s seemingly hard to find a good one I really like this one that I found online last year and modified slightly Keep in mind that with all of the white sugar in this Strawberry Cake recipe the crust of the cake gets a bit more golden brown than the other flavours This recipe makes two 9 rounds but I made cupcakes with the extra batter You could divide the recipe in half Strawberry Cake click here for printable recipe Ingredients 2 cups white sugar 1 3oz package of strawberry gelatin JELL O 1 cup butter softened 4 eggs room temperature 2 3 4 cups all purpose flour 2 1 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 cup whole milk room temperature 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1 2 cup strawberry puree made from frozen sweetened strawberries or you could use unsweetened and add a tablespoon of white sugar Method 1 Prepare two 9 round pans butter and flour or parchment lined 2 In a large bowl cream together the butter sugar and dry strawberry gelatin until light and fluffy Beat in the eggs one at a time mixing well after each Mix vanilla and milk together Combine and whisk dry ingredients adding to creamed mixture and alternating with milk vanilla until just combined Blend in strawberry puree Pour into prepared pans 3 Bake in 350 F for about 25 minutes or until inserted toothpick comes out clean Allow cakes to cool in pans on wire rack for 20 minutes then inverting onto wire rack to finish cooling Recipe for Strawberry Cake adapted from allrecipes

       "  u\"{title:Exclusive Amazon selling rape simulation game Local National News ,body:A game that involves the player stalking victims and then raping them in a virtual world is being offered for sale by online retailer Amazon com the Belfast Telegraph s website can reveal The shocking rape simulator Rapelay is set in Japan and carries a sickening game description on the Amazon website An MP said last night that he plans to raise the issue in Parliament Reviews by gaming websites have expressed horror at the basis for the game One website review describes tears glistening in the young girl s eyes as she is attacked in graphic detail Players begin the game by stalking a mother on a subway station before violently raping her They then move on to attack her two daughters described as virgin schoolgirls Players are also allowed to enter freeform mode where they can rape any woman and get other male game characters to join the attacks Pregnancy and abortion are listed as key features One review said If she does become pregnant you re supposed to force her to get an abortion otherwise she gets more and more visibly pregnant each time you have sex If you allow the child to be born then the woman will throw you in front of a train Most of the descriptions and screenshots of the game are too graphic for publication here The game s producer Illusion is a company from Japan famous for making similar 3D Hentai games The online encyclopedia Wikipedia says Due to Illusion s policy its games are not intended to be sold or used outside of Japan and official support is only given in Japanese and for use in Japan Despite this policy consumers including those in the UK and Ireland are now able to buy the game through the Amazon website Last night Labour MP Keith Vaz said he was shocked that Amazon are allowing people to purchase such a game and plans to raise the issue in Parliament after being contacted by the Belfast Telegraph website Mr Vaz said It is intolerable that anyone would purchase a game that simulates the criminal offence of rape To know that this widely available through a major online retailer is utterly shocking I do not see how this can be allowed I will be raising this matter in Parliament and hope that action is taken to prevent the game from being sold Last year the MP for Leicester East was criticised for claiming such games exist Mr Vaz was speaking in support of of Conservative MP Julian Brazier s Private Member s Bill which sought to introduce an official governmental body that can challenge rulings by the British Board of Film Classifications BBFC Vaz stated People who are watching a film at the cinema cannot participate in what is happening on the screen or if they do they are removed from the cinema However when people play these things they can interact They can shoot people they can kill people As the honourable Gentleman said they can rape women Vaz s claims were questioned by Tory MP for Wantage Edward Vaizey He told Parliament the right honourable Member for Leicester East Keith Vaz who chairs the Home Affairs Committee mentioned that some video games allow the participant to engage in a rape act I checked the point with the BBFC and found it to be completely unaware of any such video game Is the honourable Gentleman aware of any video game that has as its intention the carrying out of rape or that allows the game player to carry out such an act The BBFC and I are unaware of any such game At the time hundreds of gaming blogs slated Vaz for his comments One blog poster said This guy has no idea what he s talking about he s more likey to of never even played a game in his life just plain stupid if you ask me Only one comment appears on the Amazon website The user says 1 0 out of 5 stars The fact that this exists as a game makes me sad I am saddened and appalled by the mere idea of this game is this for real Last year the Belfast Telegraph revealed that Amazon had listed a Barack Obama mask as terrorist costume The online retailer said the offensive category was put there by someone using its tag feature and had removed it immediately Update After being contacted by the Belfast Telegraph Amazon today removed the webpage still viewable here from Google s cache A screenshot is also available at this location The company would not comment on the item or say why it had been offered for sale through their website The Amazon page Rapelay Japanese PC game by Illusion Game description on Amazon Rapelay is an offshoot of the Illusion series Interact Play You like in previous installments play as a public nuisance that gets away from captivity and starts scouting for new targets This time around you find a family of a single mother and her two daughters You quickly begin your hunt and capture each woman one by one The gameplay involves an amusing training disposition system with which to break each respective target to your liking Could games like this encourage people to commit illegal acts in the real world There have been high profile instances of individuals copying from TV and games However I think these are the exception rather than the rule If one looked at the overall proportion of people who copy such things then it is likely to be very small However to a potential victim even if one person does that is one too many I don t think that it would make someone not so inclined to commit an illegal act more inclined or likely to commit a specific act However if people are already inclined to view the world this way it may reinforce their views and make it more likely they would undertake an illegal act I suspect the will to do this would need to be there in the first place Professor Peter Hepper heads the School of Psychology at Queen s University Belfast a game that involves the player stalking victims and then raping them in a \\\\n  virtual world is being offered for sale by online retailer amazon.com, the \\\\n  belfast

       "  u'{title:15 Best Foods for Cold Flu Season ,body:Now that temperatures are dropping our immune systems are collectively becoming more vulnerable to colds and the flu It won t be long before they make their presence felt around your workplace or your child s school causing the inevitable worthlessness and misery that comes with being firmly planted on the couch for several days Fortunately there is a way you can avoid the worst of the season By eating right you ll not only feel better day to day but you ll also strengthen your immune system lessening your chances of experiencing a bad cold or flu for an extended period of time Here are the 15 best foods to eat sick or not in the coming months Garlic Incorporating garlic into your diet results in a myriad of long term and short term health benefits It contains compounds that fight bacterial viral parasitic and fungal infections Particularly helpful is allicin which is the main component that blocks unwanted enzymes The only downside of eating too much garlic is the resulting putrid breath but it s a small price to pay for strengthening your immune system Oregano Oregano is known for possessing potent antioxidants that come with its plentiful flavonoids and phenolic acids Of course you can cook using the herb along with garlic for example to have an immune boosting meal Or you can take oil of oregano which is packed with zinc magnesium calcium iron copper potassium boron and manganese Ginger Tea especially ginger tea has long been a go to home remedy for fighting colds The root contains the anti inflammatory agent shogaol which has been rigorously studied to gain insight into its remarkable health benefits Ginger primarily helps soothe headaches and nausea and it can induce sweat in order to release toxins during the onset of a cold Oats Oats are chockfull of fiber beta glucans and vitamins B and E making them advocates of both your immune system and digestive system The flu or a tough cold can take a toll on your stomach so it s important that you take measures to ensure it remains in tip top shape Oats can be added in the preparation of meats or you can simply purchase oatmeal or oat bran Mushrooms Mushrooms are worthy virus and bacteria fighters because they unleash beta glucans that stimulate the immune system searching and destroying disease causing cells They make an excellent side dish or ingredient in an existing dish Broccoli Although you may have dreaded this veggie as a kid you probably recognize its benefits now that you re an adult Broccoli promotes a strong immune system by providing glucosinolates and it s also a great source of vitamins A C and E Cabbage Like it s equally unpopular aforementioned veggie peer cabbage is more appreciated with age It s high in glucosinolates vitamin C and fiber and it can be used in a variety of dishes it s a potential ingredient for a cold soothing stew or if you re a big fan of it cabbage soup is an effective cold remedy Carrots Carrots do more than just promote eye health They increase the amount of infection fighting cells with their production of beta carotene While some opt to eat carrots on their own others choose to add them to a stew or drink them in juice form Sweet Potatoes With Thanksgiving approaching you may be stocking up on sweet potatoes in order to complete your yearly feast Be sure to set a couple aside for future use they contain lots of beta carotene and fiber They re easy to toss in the oven and eat when you re sick and don t feel like concocting an entire meal Oranges Oranges and other citrus fruits are rich in vitamin C which increases the production of white blood cells and inhibits the entry of viruses by increasing interferon levels A tall glass of OJ may keep the doctor away as long as your aren t experiencing stomach problems in which case you d be better off avoiding the highly acidic drink Lemons Looking for even more vitamin C Lemons provide 80 percent of your daily dosage What s more they can be consumed in a stomach friendly manner by diluting the juice with water accelerating your recovery time Elderberries Berries are also rich source of vitamin C and thus have always been a part of sick food diets Particularly the lesser known elderberry has a reputation for its flu fighting ability because of its large amount of vitamin C and phytochemicals that are antiviral and anti inflammatory Yogurt The live bacteria or probiotics in yogurt boost the immune system by protecting it against harmful bacteria making the dairy product an essential addition to a complete anti cold and flu diet Toss in some sliced fruit and you ll have a tasty snack that s also filled with vitamins Honey Honey is another sweet advocate of healthy bacteria It s also high in antioxidants so adding it to tea or pouring it over food will do more than just enhance the taste When you have a sore throat or persistent cough honey will coat your throat easing the irritation Oysters Oysters may not seem like typical sick food but they contribute to the immune system by adding zinc which strengthens helper T cells The result is that cells are more prepared to deal with invaders If you can t stomach the slimy mollusk consider eating other seafood chicken or beef now that temperatures are dropping, our immune systems are collectively becoming more vulnerable to colds and the flu.,url:bestcollegesonline blog 2010 15 best foods for cold flu season}',\n",

       "  u'{title:The Truth About The Health Benefits Of Tea the truth about the health benefits of tea the truth about the health benefits of tea ,body:The way scientific studies and health gurus alike have touted the perks of tea over the past few years you d think the stuff was some kind of all powerful magical elixir Improving heart health reducing cancer risk warding off dementia and diabetes there s barely a health benefit that hasn t been credited to tea It s true that the brew has disease fighting antioxidants and as far as anyone can tell should be great for us The science is certainly promising says Dr David L Katz director of Yale University s Prevention Research Center But the hype goes beyond it and tends to make promises which the science can t yet deliver No tea probably will not cure depression eliminate allergies or boost your fertility We talked to the experts and weighed the studies to separate the truth from the hype Why Tea Is So HotFirst a definition When scientists talk about tea they mean black green white or oolong teas all of which are made from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant Herbal brews like chamomile and peppermint are not technically considered tea they re infusions of other plants with different nutritional characteristics If you re not sure what kind you re drinking check the ingredients for the word tea What makes the four tea types different from each other is the way the leaves are prepared and how mature they are which affects both flavor and nutritional content Black tea is made from leaves that have been wilted dried out and then fully oxidized meaning that chemicals in the leaves are modified through exposure to air Green tea s leaves are wilted but not oxidized Oolong tea is wilted and then only partially oxidized and white tea is not wilted or oxidized at all All four types are high in polyphenols a type of antioxidant that seems to protect cells from the DNA damage that can cause cancer and other diseases It s the polyphenols that have made tea the star of so many studies as researchers try to figure out whether all that chemical potential translates into real disease fighting punch Most research has focused on black tea which is what about 75 percent of the world drinks and green tea the most commonly consumed variety in China and Japan Green tea contains an especially high amount of antioxidants in particular a type of polyphenol called a catechin the most active and abundant of which is epigallocatechin 3 gallate EGCG That s why there are five times more studies on green than black tea each year and likely why you re always hearing about the power of the green stuff says Diane L McKay assistant professor of nutrition at the Tufts University Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy More From Health com America s Healthiest Superfoods for Women The 10 Best Foods For Your Heart The Healing Power of Tea Boiling Down the Hype The most promising claims about tea drinking include these perks Cancer prevention A 2009 review of 51 green tea studies found that sipping three to five cups a day may lower the risks of ovarian colorectal lung and prostate cancers but not breast or other cancers says lead author Katja Boehm research fellow at the Center of Integrative Medicine at the University of Witten Herdecke in Germany As for black tea the National Institutes of Health NIH deems it possibly effective for reducing the risk of ovarian cancer and possibly ineffective for lowering the risk of stomach and colorectal cancers Brain benefits Downing from one to four cups of black or green tea a day has been linked with a lower risk of Parkinson s disease according to the NIH Heart help Drinking tea may be helpful in preventing or delaying certain risk factors of cardiovascular disease and lowering LDL bad cholesterol and triglycerides says McKay One Japanese study found that adults who drank five or more cups of green tea per day had a 26 percent reduction in death from heart attack or stroke compared with those who had one cup or less the effect was greater in women than in men More research needs to be done on other potential benefits One small study suggested that the catechins and caffeine in green tea may give dieters a small metabolic boost that could amount to burning a few dozen extra calories per day There s also a slim file on how drinking tea may help ward off osteoporosis and reduce the incidence of cavities due to the fluoride it contains And EGCG that green tea antioxidant has been found to increase the number of important immune boosting cells called regulatory T cells but only in one animal study Smart SipsAll this sounds pretty compelling So why aren t major health organizations advising us to drink tea like crazy It s a matter of needing more hard core evidence There are pearls of real promise here but they have yet to be strung Katz says We don t have clinical trials in human patients showing that adding tea to one s routine changes health outcomes for the better The vast majority of the research conducted has been observational meaning scientists can t know if the medical boosts seen in tea drinkers are definitely a result of that habit or some other factor that makes these people healthier And many of the studies that have looked at specific compounds in tea have been conducted in labs or on animals not on people These chemicals act as antioxidants in a test tube but they may not do the same in your body explains Emily Ho associate professor in the department of nutrition and exercise science at the School of Biological and Population Health Sciences at Oregon State University You have to take the claims with a grain of salt That said experts agree that a daily cuppa or five won t hurt you and may well help fight disease If you re trying to limit your caffeine intake go for decaf it has antioxidants too though fewer than the caffeinated kind Tea is probably better than a lot of other beverages says Lona Sandon a registered dietitian and assistant professor in the department of clinical nutrition at UT South western Medical Center and a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association Just make sure you ve got other healthy lifestyle habits you can t count on tea alone to prevent cancer nih,prostate,osteoporosis,cancer,bad cholesterol,risk

       "  u'{title:The 5 Best Dark Chocolate Bars in the World ,body:Welcome Stumblers and all newcomers If you want to lose weight gain muscle increase energy levels reduce stress or just generally look and feel healthier you ve come to the right place Subscribe to my free weekly newsletter for tips advice and special insider only information Learn more about the Primal Lifestyle by visiting the Primal Blueprint 101 page Thanks for visiting The Modern Paleo blog s been doing chocolate reviews recently which struck me as a novel but totally understandable practice for a blog called Modern Paleo In my mind good dark chocolate high cacao content high fat low ish sugar stuff makes any downsides to living in this modern world well worth it Good dark chocolate really is that good And one of the best parts about going Primal has been the way my heightened sensitivity to the slightest dash of sugar enables true appreciation of the bean s slightly sweet product I ve eaten a lot of chocolate in my day Cheap American milk chocolate with an absurdly low cacao content was regularly gobbled up in my endurance days but I ve since moved on to more bitter pastures About five years ago I could enjoy your standard mid grade bittersweet dark chocolate without worrying about the cacao content percentage Now I find the sweetness of anything lower than 72 cloyingly overpowering That s not to say I don t like being overpowered by intense flavor because I do but only when that flavor is based on the bean So yeah 72 is too low and even the late 70s are generally pushing too much sugar I try to stick to the 80s and even 90s You might notice that my picks are not inexpensive They aren t throwaway bars to be wolfed down in between mouthfuls of movie popcorn in a single sitting In fact throughout the composition of this post the tasting the writing the sampling I probably ate almost an entire bar s worth of really high quality super dark chocolate It wasn t easy It was probably too much Normally I ll eat a square maybe two after dinner a few times a week so I m preparing myself for an impending stomachache We ll see My point is this good dark chocolate is self limiting You won t go crazy and pig out on it because it isn t pleasant to do so The quality stuff always lasts longer than the cheap stuff Quality dark chocolate is definitely worth the extra expenditure Of course what actually constitutes the best dark chocolate in the world is subjective These happen to be some of my favorites at least for now My top picks are always changing as I never fail to try whatever high quality low sugar dark chocolate wanders into my life or appears in the checkout line In no particular order the list Valrhona Noir Extra Amer 85 Cacao 2 5 servings per bar Each serving 20g fat 12g saturated 15g carbs 6g fiber 5g sugar This bar looks fantastic sleek smooth and dark almost black with a hint of red A single square if given sufficient mouth time will slowly smoothly melt revealing floral nutty and coffee notes If you try real hard you may notice cinnamon too I think the biggest draw is the texture which is silky gosh I sound like a chocolate advertisement using words like silky That single square will resonate for several minutes provided you don t just chomp down without allowing it to melt The Noir Extra Amer goes well in a pot of spicy chili right at the end just before serving I get mine at Trader Joe s for 2 99 a bar Chocolove XOXOX Extra Strong Dark 77 Cacao 3 servings per bar Each serving 13g fat 8g saturated 11g carbs 3g fiber 6g sugar The Chocolove XOXOX may have a ridiculously cheesy name and a slightly higher sugar content but if you want a non abrasive introductory dark chocolate for beginners this is it If you re trying to wean your significant other off of milk chocolate go with the Chocolove XOXOX You get the unmistakable flavor and light sugar content of a high cacao bar with the creaminess and accessibility of a lesser cacao bar I keep these on hand for those times where I just want a bit of sweetness without the commitment required by the heavy darks It tastes a bit like coconut You can find this bar at Whole Foods Target or Cost Plus Green and Black s Dark 85 Cacao 2 5 servings per bar Each serving 21g fat 13g saturated 14g carbs 5g fiber 6g sugar Another brilliantly dark bar with glimpses of red the Green and Black s Dark is similar to the Valrhona in its mouthfeel It s creamy silky smooth and melts very well but it s not quite so bitter Oh the bitterness is there lurking and noticeable but it isn t overpowering You almost have to look for it although beginners might notice it right away Sometimes I like the bitterness to dominate When I don t want that kind of bitterness I reach for a Green and Black s which strikes an impressive balance between robustness and delicateness Find where to buy Green and Black s near you Dagoba Eclipse 87 Cacao 1 serving per bar Each serving 26g fat 16g saturated 19g carb 8g fiber 7g sugar Dagoba is an odd one I like it nay love it but it s definitely not an everyday sort of chocolate bar If it s the only thing in the house I can probably work my way through it in two weeks with dedication and yet it s the most intriguing chocolate I ve had Complex flavors include fruit clove allspice and other spice mixes There s even a bit of red wine in there making actual wine pairing redundant or even antagonistic No this bar stands alone The texture isn t great though and instead of melting into smooth oblivion it gets rather dry toward the end but this is accompanied by flavor intensification if you can imagine such a thing There s a tradeoff that s worth exploring I get Dagoba Eclipse at Whole Foods but you can also order it online Scharffen Berger Extra Dark 82 Cacao 2 servings per bar Each serving 19g fat 12g saturated 17g carbs 6g fiber 8g sugar Figs and red wine honey and spice y There s even a bit of esperesso lurking in there It s not just the cacao that s bitter there s a bite that lingers minutes after you ve taken it That acidic bite effectively staves off the worst of the let s face it sometimes too much bitterness where a lesser manufacturer would have loaded a bar up with sugar to dull it I m glad Scharffen Berger did not do so Give this to daring beginners One of my new personal favorites that didn t make the cut is the 85 Ecuador dark chocolate out of the Santa Barbara Chocolate Company We had the 72 at PrimalCon but the 85 is even better Definitely keep your eyes out for it If I had it on hand to sample this list woulda been six deep Lindt 85 is another good option especially if you can t find any of the above choices Lindt is available in most standard grocery stores and Walmart One last thing remember that the serving size listed on the back of dark chocolate bars is usually quite high often around half a bar per serving Depending on the bar I get 6 12 or more servings per bar Consider this when calculating the carb values per serving above What are your favorites Have I missed anything What should I try next Let me know in the comment section Get Free Health Tips Recipes and Workouts Delivered to Your Inbox the

       "  u'{title:Are Fans a Part of the Team Definitive Rules on When Fans Can Use We are fans a part of the team? definitive rules on when fans can use \\\\we\\\\,body:My good friend Andy Hutchins sent me a tweet yesterday from Chris Jones of Grantland telling fans when they should and should not use the first person or perhaps first persons we when addressing their favorite team Jones is right and he s wrong Here s a breakdown of when and why fans should use the term we But first a story There s always a story I was sitting in a bar a few years having this debate with a table full of academic types who worked at the Rutgers Newark campus the football team is part of the main campus in New Brunswick In talking about Rutgers football I used the term we several times One of the academics corrected my usage with a mocking tone stating unequivocally that I was not allowed to use the term we because I was not a member of the team But I don t just work at the University like you I explained I actually work with the football team every single day That was not enough for the academic I designed the logo as well as the football field and the basketball court they play on Not enough said another academic at the table who most likely corrected my use of a preposition to end that sentence as well If I wasn t playing on those surfaces or wearing the uniform with that logo I should not say we That academic was adamant That academic would not relent That academic got the rest of the table to turn against me That academic was my wife We had a long ride home that day The thing is she was wrong And to a lesser extent Jones is wrong too Here are some definitive rules for when sports fans can use the term we Rule 1 Players This is obvious If you are a player on a team you should read must say we Rule 2 CoachesGranted coaches aren t on the field making plays that decide the outcome of the game Sometimes we fought hard out there does sound a bit funny coming from a coach but the fact of the matter is coaches work harder than almost anyone sometimes that includes players to prepare for each game It s their team They should say we Rule 3 Front Office Personnel Support Staff Everyone from the person who picks the players and pays the bills to the person who lines the field should say we It s part of team pride You spend your time at work preparing each day for the next game If the game cannot go on without you or the gameday experience is not as good without your hard work and dedication you are certainly part of the group of we no matter what my wife and her bookish friends tell you Rule 4 Former Players In today s ever changing media landscape this is a dicey one Does Jerry Rice say we when talking about the 49ers He played for two teams after the Niners remember and he also works for ESPN as an analyst Having said that there s not a person on the planet more synonymous with the 49ers than Rice so if he didn t say we it might sound weird Look TV networks aren t suddenly going to stop hiring former athletes and we ahem as a viewership have come to terms with the fact that analysts all have bias based on where they ve played Do we respect Troy Aikman for being able to call a Cowboys game without bias or do we respect the fact that he does a great job of covering up that bias Does it matter if the person played for a team to have bias Chris Berman has always had a thing for the 49ers and Bills and wagons that circle so it stands to reason that his opinion of those franchises is just as biased as for example Tom Jackson s opinion of Denver or Mike Ditka s opinion of Chicago That being said a former player is always part of the history of a team If that player is not a member of the media we should expect to hear we Rule 5 College If you went to a college you should say we when talking about your school s team Your alma mater is a part of who you are The players on your college team aren t just playing for those at the school now but represent everyone who came before them both on and off the field If you went to a school you are a part of that school Forever It s we Rule 6 All Fans Let s go back to Andy Hutchins reason for sending me the original tweet This is what he said I just hate people who let other people tell them how to enjoy life In other words Andy thinks and many fans agree that fans shouldn t feel pressured by members of the media to act a certain way about something they love The nature of being a fan is inherently irrational so making yourself part of something by using we just feeds into that idea With that logic anyone should be allowed to say we if they feel they are connected to a team that closely Let s explore this idea from a more linear standpoint Owners hire players to represent their franchise Owners pay for the players salaries through two basic revenue streams television dollars and ticket sales You can add in parking concessions and merchandise into the basic idea of ticket sales On a basic level the owners make money off selling things to fans Fans therefore feel a sense of ownership of the team note in Green Bay fans actually have ownership of the team by using their money to buy the things that make the owners enough money to be able to pay the players the fans will support by purchasing more tickets and merchandise that in turn helps the owners make more money to pay the players it s the circle of life Maybe by plunking down hundreds of dollars to sit in the stands and wear team colors fans have earned the right to say we Or as Hutchins put it maybe it s not up to us Maybe it s up to each individual fan how they handle their relationship with their team Maybe I ve actually come around on this We don t judge people for the relationship they have with their God note We certainly do judge people for that but reasonable people know we re not supposed to so why should we judge people for their relationship with their team Maybe it s time we let we be free for everyone opinion, multiple sports, flagship, wideleft, googlenews standout my good friend andy hutchins sent me a tweet yesterday from chris jones of grantland telling fans

       "  u'{title:40 facts about sleep you probably never heard ,body:40 FACTS ABOUT SLEEP YOU PROBABLY DIDN T KNOW OR WERE TOO TIRED TO THINK ABOUT The record for the longest period without sleep is 18 days 21 hours 40 minutes during a rocking chair marathon The record holder reported hallucinations paranoia blurred vision slurred speech and memory and concentration lapses It s impossible to tell if someone is really awake without close medical supervision People can take cat naps with their eyes open without even being aware of it Anything less than five minutes to fall asleep at night means you re sleep deprived The ideal is between 10 and 15 minutes meaning you re still tired enough to sleep deeply but not so exhausted you feel sleepy by day A new baby typically results in 400 750 hours lost sleep for parents in the first year One of the best predictors of insomnia later in life is the development of bad habits from having sleep disturbed by young children The continuous brain recordings that led to the discovery of REM rapid eye movement sleep were not done until 1953 partly because the scientists involved were concerned about wasting paper REM sleep occurs in bursts totalling about 2 hours a night usually beginning about 90 minutes after falling asleep Dreams once thought to occur only during REM sleep also occur but to a lesser extent in non REM sleep phases It s possible there may not be a single moment of our sleep when we are actually dreamless REM dreams are characterised by bizarre plots but non REM dreams are repetitive and thought like with little imagery obsessively returning to a suspicion you left your mobile phone somewhere for example Certain types of eye movements during REM sleep correspond to specific movements in dreams suggesting at least part of the dreaming process is analagous to watching a film No one knows for sure if other species dream but some do have sleep cycles similar to humans Elephants sleep standing up during non REM sleep but lie down for REM sleep Some scientists believe we dream to fix experiences in long term memory that is we dream about things worth remembering Others reckon we dream about things worth forgetting to eliminate overlapping memories that would otherwise clog up our brains Dreams may not serve any purpose at all but be merely a meaningless byproduct of two evolutionary adaptations sleep and consciousness REM sleep may help developing brains mature Premature babies have 75 per cent REM sleep 10 per cent more than full term bubs Similarly a newborn kitten puppy rat or hampster experiences only REM sleep while a newborn guinea pig which is much more developed at birth has almost no REM sleep at all Scientists have not been able to explain a 1998 study showing a bright light shone on the backs of human knees can reset the brain s sleep wake clock British Ministry of Defence researchers have been able to reset soldiers body clocks so they can go without sleep for up to 36 hrs Tiny optical fibres embedded in special spectacles project a ring of bright white light with a spectrum identical to a sunrise around the edge of soldiers retinas fooling them into thinking they have just woken up The system was first used on US pilots during the bombing of Kosovo Seventeen hours of sustained wakefulness leads to a decrease in performance equivalent to a blood alcohol level of 0 05 The 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska the Challenger space shuttle disaster and the Chernobyl nuclear accident have all been attributed to human errors in which sleep deprivation played a role The NRMA estimates fatigue is involved in one in 6 fatal road accidents Exposure to noise at night can suppress immune function even if the sleeper doesn t wake Unfamiliar noise and noise during the first and last two hours of sleep has the greatest disruptive effect on the sleep cycle The natural alarm clock which enables some people to wake up more or less when they want to is caused by a burst of the stress hormone adrenocorticotropin Researchers say this reflects an unconscious anticipation of the stress of waking up Some sleeping tablets such as barbiturates suppress REM sleep which can be harmful over a long period In insomnia following bereavement sleeping pills can disrupt grieving Tiny luminous rays from a digital alarm clock can be enough to disrupt the sleep cycle even if you do not fully wake The light turns off a neural switch in the brain causing levels of a key sleep chemical to decline within minutes To drop off we must cool off body temperature and the brain s sleep wake cycle are closely linked That s why hot summer nights can cause a restless sleep The blood flow mechanism that transfers core body heat to the skin works best between 18 and 30 degrees But later in life the comfort zone shrinks to between 23 and 25 degrees one reason why older people have more sleep disorders A night on the grog will help you get to sleep but it will be a light slumber and you won t dream much After five nights of partial sleep deprivation three drinks will have the same effect on your body as six would when you ve slept enough Humans sleep on average around three hours less than other primates like chimps rhesus monkeys squirrel monkeys and baboons all of whom sleep for 10 hours Ducks at risk of attack by predators are able to balance the need for sleep and survival keeping one half of the brain awake while the other slips into sleep mode Ten per cent of snorers have sleep apnoea a disorder which causes sufferers to stop breathing up to 300 times a night and significantly increases the risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke Snoring occurs only in non REM sleep Teenagers need as much sleep as small children about 10 hrs while those over 65 need the least of all about six hours For the average adult aged 25 55 eight hours is considered optimal Some studies suggest women need up to an hour s extra sleep a night compared to men and not getting it may be one reason women are much more susceptible to depression than men Feeling tired can feel normal after a short time Those deliberately deprived of sleep for research initially noticed greatly the effects on their alertness mood and physical performance but the awareness dropped off after the first few days Diaries from the pre electric light globe Victorian era show adults slept nine to 10 hours a night with periods of rest changing with the seasons in line with sunrise and sunsets Most of what we know about sleep we ve learned in the past 25 years As a group 18 to 24 year olds deprived of sleep suffer more from impaired performance than older adults Experts say one of the most alluring sleep distractions is the 24 hour accessibility of the internet The extra hour of sleep received when clocks are put back at the start of daylight in Canada has been found to coincide with a fall in the number of road accidents If you liked this post please buy me a cup of coffee to quench my

       "  u\"{title:Local News UW students surprised by teacher s role in Libya uw students surprised by teacher's role in libya ,body:Originally published March 25 2011 at 7 02 AM Page modified March 25 2011 at 9 16 AM SEATTLE A month ago when professor Ali Tarhouni told his microeconomics class at the University of Washington that he had a death sentence on his head in his native Libya but that he had decided to return home to help advise the rebel army on economic issues his students were stunned by the news It was kind of jaw dropping said student Sara Jones And then he clapped his hands and said Back to class Tarhouni 60 a lecturer at the UW since 1985 and a favorite among students for his engaging style and dry wit left Seattle on Feb 27 to join the rebels shadow government in Libya and was appointed its finance minister this week Tarhouni is best known at the UW for making microeconomics theory easy to understand But few people in Seattle knew that the longtime business school lecturer has led a kind of double life as an exiled leader of the Libyan rebel movement said Ed Rice associate professor of finance and business economics at the UW Tarhouni and other native Libyans who opposed Moammar Gadhafi have stayed in touch through meetings and more recently Skype conference calls during Gadhafi s 42 year reign said Tarhouni s wife Mary Li There are many active members of the opposition all over the world and they ve all gone back to Libya now Li said The Libyan opposition has never not existed so this is just kind of a natural progression Rice said he used to joke with Tarhouni that he would become prime minister of Libya one day But in the past decade Tarhouni seemed discouraged that Gadhafi remained in power and that the underground rebel movement had failed to oust him Rice said And then with the remarkable turn of events that started with the recent Tunisian uprising Tarhouni was called to join the rebels in Libya As most of you know I spent the better part of my life fighting to bring democracy to Libya and just about everything that I attempted failed Tarhouni wrote in an email he circulated to friends and former students on Feb 27 Out of nowhere a volcano erupted These young people who are marching only with stones in their hands facing grenades and live bullets are writing a new chapter for Libya similar to their brethren in Tunisia and Egypt He went on to write I am not sure who is alive and who is dead but I feel that I need to go back to help as much as I can U S Rep Jim McDermott D Seattle got a call from Tarhouni in Libya about a week ago the professor asked McDermott to support the no fly zone he does and to encourage the U S to recognize the rebels provisional government McDermott said he knows Tarhouni but didn t realize just how deeply involved he is in Libyan politics I think we have an international community in Seattle that s involved in lots of stuff and you never know about it until major international news puts those people in the spotlight he said In his last class at the UW Jones said Tarhouni spent about 10 minutes describing how he had been a student activist in the 1970s and was later kicked out of college for his part in a movement calling for democracy and greater freedoms He left Libya in 1973 and in the 1980s was put on a Libyan government hit list He was so humble about it she said He was so modest about everything Although Tarhouni s formal title is senior lecturer his students call him Professor Tarhouni Jones said he has a more informal style than many professors in the business school often wearing jeans along with his blazer and sitting on the edge of a desk while leading discussions Notably Tarhouni doesn t use PowerPoint presentations as many professors do and opens almost every class with a discussion of world events and their relevance to microeconomics said Jones who is also the assistant director for the technical management MBA program He s a brilliant teacher said former student Paul Zitarelli who said Tarhouni could make microeconomics theory sing for those who had never had a class on it at all to those who d majored in it Zitarelli said he feels a weird mix of pride and apprehension about Tarhouni s role in Libya apprehension especially about his safety Since he left Jones has been searching for news of Tarhouni online The lecturer s name often pops up in international posts but since Wednesday when he was named finance minister he s been quoted frequently in mainstream U S publications and in radio interviews On Wednesday night he briefed journalists in Libya on the situation and appeared to be one of the few rebel officials willing to speak plainly about the movement s shortcomings and challenges according to a story in The New York Times Tarhouni s particular gift as a teacher is emphasizing the most important take away points that students needed to grasp in order to understand business concepts He would stress those very basic things that provided students with key understandings Rice said In the days to come as finance minister for a rebel government that skill may become one of Tarhouni s greatest contributions to the movement Rice said Information from The Seattle Times http www seattletimes com ,url:seattletimes nwsource html localnews 2014596523 apwalibyarebelfinances1stldwritethru html}\",\n",

       "  u'{title:Coca Cola drinking the world dry ,body:19 November 2007 Coca Cola is one of the most recognisable brands in the world The company claims to adhere to the highest ethical standards and to be an outstanding corporate citizen in every community we serve Yet Coca Cola s activities around the world tell a different story Coca Cola has been accused of dehydrating communities in its pursuit of water resources to feed its own plants drying up farmers wells and destroying local agriculture The company has also violated workers rights in countries such as Colombia Turkey Guatemala and Russia Only through its multi million dollar marketing campaigns can Coca Cola sustain the clean image it craves The company admits that without water it would have no business at all Coca Cola s operations rely on access to vast supplies of water as it takes almost three litres of water to make one litre of Coca Cola In order to satisfy this need Coca Cola is increasingly taking over control of aquifers in communities around the world These vast subterranean chambers hold water resources collected over many hundreds of years As such they the represent the heritage of entire communities Coca Cola s operations have particularly been blamed for exacerbating water shortages in regions that suffer from a lack of water resources and rainfall Nowhere has this been better documented than in India where there are now community campaigns against the company in several states research carried out by War on Want in the Indian states of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh affirms the findings from Kerala and Maharastra that Coca Cola s activities are having a serious negative impact on farmers and local communities Coca Cola established a bottling plant in the village of Kaladera in Rajasthan at the end of 1999 Rajasthan is well known as a desert state and Kaladera is a small impoverished village characterised by semi arid conditions Farmers rely on access to groundwater for the cultivation of their crops but since Coca Cola s arrival they have been confronted with a serious decline in water levels Locals are increasingly unable to irrigate their lands and sustain their crops putting whole families at risk of losing their livelihoods Local villagers testify that Coca Cola s arrival exacerbated an already precarious situation Official documents from the government s water ministry show that water levels remained stable from 1995 until 2000 when the Coca Cola plant became operational Water levels then dropped by almost 10 metres over the following five years Locals fear Kaladera could become a dark zone the term used to describe areas that are abandoned due to depleted water resources Other communities in India that live and work around Coca Cola s bottling plants are experiencing severe water shortages as well as environmental damage Local villagers near the holy city of Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh complain that the company s over exploitation of water resources has taken a heavy toll on their harvests and led to the drying up of wells As in Rajasthan and Kerala villagers have held protests against the local Coca Cola plant for its appropriation of valuable water resources In the now infamous case of Plachimada in the southern state of Kerala Coca Cola s plant was forced to close down in March 2004 after the village council refused to renew the company s licence on the grounds that it had over used and contaminated local water resources Four months earlier the Kerala High Court had ruled that Coca Cola s heavy extraction from the common groundwater resource was illegal and ordered it to seek alternative sources for its production In 2003 the independent Centre for Science and Environment tested Coca Cola beverages and found levels of pesticides around 30 times higher than European Union standards Levels of DDT which is banned in agriculture in India were nine times higher than the EU limit In February 2004 Indian MPs who investigated CSE s studies upheld these findings and the Parliament went on to ban Coca Cola from its cafeterias Besides these issues War on Want s Alternative Report on Coca Cola also details how Coca Cola is having a devastating impact of water resources elsewhere In El Salvador the company has been accused of exhausting water resources over a 25 year period In Chiapas Coca Cola is positioning itself to take control of the water resources The Mexican government under Vicente Fox himself a former President of Coca Cola Mexico has given the company concessions to exploit community water resources Coca Cola s own workers have also suffered and the company is being increasingly associated with anti union activities The most notable case is in Colombia where paramilitaries have killed eight Coca Cola workers since 1990 The main Coca Cola trade union Sinaltrainal is seeking to hold Coca Cola liable for using paramilitaries to engage in anti union violence Coca Cola is being sued on behalf of transport workers and their families for its part in the alleged intimidation and torture of trade unionists and their families by special branch police in Turkey In Nicaragua workers of the main Coca Cola union SUTEC have been denied the right to organise and the General Secretary of SUTEC Daniel Reyes believes the objective of this ongoing and escalating campaign is to crush the union Guatemalan workers have been struggling against Coca Cola since the 1970s In the years between 1976 and 1985 three general secretaries of the main union were assassinated and members of their families friends and legal advisers were threatened arrested kidnapped shot tortured and forced into exile The violations of workers rights continue And Coca Cola workers and their family members with ties to unions have reportedly been subjected to death threats Elsewhere in countries such as Peru Russia and Chile Coca Cola workers have been protesting against the company s anti union policies Coca Cola claims to exist to benefit and refresh everyone it touches and to try to sustain this positive image the company spends 2 billion a year on advertising alone Yet there are signs that the image is beginning to crumble The relay carrying the Olympic flame was repeatedly disrupted by protests at Coca Cola s role as the principal sponsor with the Turin council actually declaring the city a no go zone for the company a decision subsequently overruled by the mayor University campuses throughout the USA and Europe have voted to cancel contracts with Coca Cola in protest at its operations and in solidarity with the community resistance which has escalated in many countries across the world It is up to us to keep up the pressure on Coca Cola and also send a strong message to our elected leaders to rein in irresponsible business practices Tags campaigns cocacola, water, resources, cocacolas, have, company, their, workers, local, union, communities, levels, world, around, plant, also,

broth is seasoned while stock is just a blank slate 26 Pesto 0 64 per 2 tablespoons homemade 0 72 for Buitoni brandThe crisp green taste of pesto is best when made with ultra fresh basil Store bought brands tend to compensate with loads of oil and salt When that basil plant s growing as quick as a weed grab a few handfuls and combine with a touch of olive oil cheese pine nuts and garlic If basil s out of season capitalize on in season greens like kale or spinach Bonus points for superfood greens 27 Pasta 0 34 per \\\\u00bc lb serving homemade 0 62 per \\\\u00bc lb serving Bionaturae brandIt s

       "  u'{title:Banana Macadamia Nut Upside Down Cake Spiked with Dark Rum What We re Eating A Food Recipe Blog ,body:Since moving to the tropics my house seems to have an endless supply of ripe bananas Two bucks from the man hocking them in the middle of the street will get you about 15 perfectly ripe ones There are only so many bananas tmy two roommates and I can eat in a day and 5 a piece just ain t happenin Due to this cheap seemingly constant over abundance I have been dreaming up new ways to use the bananas before they turn from speckled brown to black and rotten You don t even want to know the countless loaves of banana bread I have made in the past month Actually you do want to know this since the whole wheat coconut banana bread I just made was off the chain I ll do a post on that as soon as I make it again it was so good it was gobbled up before I had a chance to photo In general one of my favorite desserts is the upside down cake I mean it combines fresh fruit brown sugar toffee esque caramel y goodness and fluffy cake How is that ever an equation for anything less than awesome It s not Don t try to fight me on this one This current cake is kind of a clean out the pantry upside down cake Excess bananas to use before they rot check Half of a container of macadamia nuts that have been sitting on the shelf for a couple of months check Self rising cake flour that I accidentally bought instead of regular cake flour check Dark rum that would likely lead me to do debaucherous activities if I drank rather than cooked with double check Regardless of how I dreamed up this cake it was freaking delicious So good that my roomies and I decided I had to get it out of the house ASAP so we wouldn t eat more than one slice per person So of course I took it to my local rum shack and gave it to the staff before sitting at the bar and consuming some more of that rum I was trying to stay away from Oh well you can t win em all right Banana Macadamia Nut Upside Down Cake Spiked with Dark Rum For topping 6 tbsp butter3 4 cup packed dark brown sugar1 4 cup dark rum1 4 tsp kosher salt1 2 tsp ground cinnamon1 8 tsp ground nutmeg1 8 tsp ground allspice4 ripe bananas cut in half length wise1 2 cup macadamia nuts roughly chopped For the cake 1 stick 1 2 cup of butter at room temperature3 4 cup packed light brown sugar2 eggs1 tsp good vanilla extract1 2 tsp almond or hazelnut extract1 tsp ground cinnamon1 4 tsp ground nutmeg1 8 tsp ground allspice3 bananas mashed1 3 4 cup self rising cake flour1 3 cup whole milk1 4 cup dark rum Preheat oven to 350 degrees with a rack positioned in the middle of the oven Place 6 tbsp butter into a sautepan over medium heat Once the butter has melted add 3 4 cup brown sugar to the butter Stir until dissolved about 3 5 minutes Once dissolved add dark rum to pan Carefully light rum on fire with a long reach lighter Let the flame from the rum burn off on its own then stir the caramel sauce over the heat until all sugar lumps have dissolved Add cinnamon nutmeg allspice to the sauce Stir to incorporate then pour sauce into a 9 round cake pan to coat the bottom evenly Sprinkle macadamia nuts over the caramel sauce then line the bottom of the pan with banana halves Set pan aside and prepare batter In a large mixing bowl or bowl of a standmixer cream together brown sugar and butter Add eggs one at a time beating stirring after each addition until completely incorporated Add vanilla almond extract cinnamon nutmeg allspice mashed bananas Stir until incorporated Add 1 3 of the flour Beat until just barely incorporated Using a rubber spatula scrape down the walls of the bowl then add 1 2 of the milk mixture Beat until just incorporated Repeat this process by adding 1 3 the flour then 1 2 the milk and finally 1 3 the flour until all ingredients have just been incorporated It s very important not to over beat the batter as that will lead to a tough cake rather than a tender crumbly one Pour batter into cake pan over the bananas Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil Place filled cake pan onto the aluminum foil lined pan to catch any caramel that may bubble over during the baking process Place into preheated 350 degree oven on middle rack Bake for 50 to 55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean a couple of crumbs are okay but NO batter should be present Place cake on a wire rack to cool for 15 minutes Run a knife around the edges of the pan to loosen Place a plate over the pan then invert the cake onto the plate Gently lift the cake pan up to reveal the upside down cake Use a rubber spatula scrape any remaining brown sugar syrup out of the bottom of the pan and on to the cake Upside down cakes are best eaten warm the day they are made Enjoy Possibly with some vanilla coconut or buttered rum ice cream if you are so inclined ,url:whatwereeating recipes banana macadamia nut upside down cake spiked with dark rum}',\n",

document getElementById bigPic innerHTML Feb 22 2012 11 59 AM Posted by Molly Aronica Editor What factors make any given restaurant that much better than another In a country with so many great eating places to choose from seeking out the best ones can be a daunting feat and could quite possibly inspire blood boiling debate Just how good is that cozy neighborhood spot with the best spaghetti and meatballs you ve ever had What about that impossible to get into sushi bar that serves 20 perfectly executed courses to a handful of lucky diners every night And who s to say the best restaurant in America isn t a barbecue place so incredible that both visitors and locals are willing to wait in line for three hours for sliced brisket and ribs Bearing this in mind we offer The Daily Meal s list of the 101 Best Restaurants in America for 2012 Click here for the 101 Best Restaurants in America 2012 Slideshow This is our second annual attempt to acknowledge and rank the multitude of great restaurants on every level with which our country is blessed and it should be noted that while a third of last year s restaurants fell off 68 of the places that made the cut last year also secured a spot in 2012 That turnover made room for a considerable handful of new fresh places and familiar spots that didn t show up in 2011 How did we come up with our list of America s best The first step was a nomination process An illustrious panel of judges comprised primarily of restaurant critics food and lifestyle writers and assorted bloggers from across the country examined the list of 2011 s winners and offered nominations for new restaurants to be considered Next The Daily Meal s editors added their nominations ending up with a total of 202 nominations and prepared a survey that allowed participants to vote for their favorites The voting based on cuisine region and a number of specific factors including formality of food and atmosphere level of buzz and price range narrowed the list to 101 As was the case last year the spectrum of restaurants ranged from chef driven neighborhood spots and avant garde restaurants to iconic casual establishments Each restaurant had the chance to be voted on three times during the survey Finally the percentage scores from each category were averaged to arrive at the final ranking The results were both fascinating and refreshing Thomas Keller got knocked out of the top spot and barely made the top five with the French Laundry coming in at number five and Per Se falling to number seven they placed first and second respectively in 2011 Interestingly but perhaps not surprisingly Le Bernardin took the list s top spot with an extensive dining room renovation and a revivified menu the restaurant had the industry elite and devoted diners alike abuzz all year Two newcomers to the list Eleven Madison Park and Gramercy Tavern both placed in the top 10 in 2012 Geographically speaking New York City restaurants took top billing taking five seats in the top 10 California especially restaurants in the areas surrounding Los Angeles and San Francisco came in second place regionally Citronelle topped the list for D C for the second year running and Alinea owned Chicago and claimed the number two spot overall The regional breakdown is just as interesting For instance our judges deemed Franklin Barbecue which wasn t even on the list last year to be the highest ranking restaurant in the South and Pok Pok another newcomer to this list was rated the best restaurant in the Northwest Not including the restaurants that made the list from New York City there were so many nominated that restaurants in Manhattan were divided by neighborhood in the survey Blue Hill at Stone Barns topped the list for Northeast restaurants Looking at The Daily Meal s list of 101 Best Restaurants in America for 2012 by cuisine proves less surprising Restaurants serving American fare both standard traditional and modern dominated especially those that focus on seasonal ingredients When it comes to the list s newer restaurants the ones that offer an edgier and often more casual approach to ethnic cuisine California was the home of the most winners The list includes all kinds of restaurants there are pizza places such as Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana in New Haven Conn and Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix taco joints like La Taqueria in San Francisco and a handful of real down home spots serving up food without frills like Ben s Chili Bowl in Washington D C and Arthur Bryant s in Kansas City Mo Right beside those more casual eateries are fine dining restaurants that are constantly bringing innovation to the culinary scene and ones that stand as iconic beacons of light that have guided the industry for decades It appears that The New York Times revered dining section would agree with this philosophy given Pete Wells review of Shake Shack this week You may question the final results Katz s Deli is better than Next and wonder aloud how on earth one restaurant made the list when it s so clear to you that another one that didn t is much more deserving Ben s Chili Bowl made it but Meadowood didn t But given the nature of the content being ranked with restaurants and dining experiences as subjective as they are it would be surprising if there weren t some disagreements Please do let us know what you think we ve missed or misranked though We ll publish a follow up with your comments and opinions and hey if you turn us on to some great places we ve somehow missed so much the better There s always next year 101 Best

       "  u\"{title:ASPARTAME Sweet but deadly poison News Jamaica Gleaner Tuesday jamaica gleaner online,body:As public awareness about the dangers of sugar has increased many people now use artificial sweeteners to satisfy their sweet tooth By far the most popular artificial sweetener found in restaurants groceries supermarkets and in our own kitchens and on our dining tables is aspartame It is marketed under trade names like NutraSweet Equal or AminoSweet In fact you can hardly buy a stick of gum or a box of candy without being offered a dose of aspartame Even worse without carefully reading the label you would not even suspect that a product contains aspartame On most restaurant tables right alongside the packets of white sugar unhealthy in their own right are pretty pink and blue packets of the chemical aspartame a well known poison technically called an excitotoxin Have you had your excitotoxins today Advertisements for aspartame portray it as a healthy alternative to sugar This makes aspartame even more dangerous to consumers who are ignorant of the artificial sweetener s dangerous side effects Sadly because of this deception many health conscious people regularly use aspartame sweetened products ASPARTAMEAspartame is a synthetic chemical composed of two amino acids phenylalanine and aspartic acid bonded with methyl alcohol Methyl alcohol breaks down in the body to formic acid the poison in ants sting and formaldehyde embalming fluid Each time you drink a diet soft drink or chew sugarless gum containing aspartame you are feeding your body with unhealthy doses of these substances The amino acids can go directly to the brain and alter the function of your nervous system Your brain naturally uses phenylalanine but aspartame consumption exposes your brain to excessively high phenylalanine concentrations Research has shown that elevated brain phenylalanine levels increase the risk of seizures The other chemicals methyl alcohol formic acid and formaldehyde are also extremely toxic substances By the way MSG another excitotoxin acts in synergy with aspartame to worsen the damage they both cause Reactions and Side Effects of AspartameAs far back as the 1980s the US Department of Health and Human Services received over 10 000 complaints regarding adverse reactions to aspartame However the enormous power of vested economic interests contrived to prove that aspartame was perfectly safe One expert Dr Janet Starr Hull listed the following as only some of the common side effects of aspartame use Nervous system epileptic seizures headaches migraine severe dizziness unsteadiness memory loss drowsiness and sleepiness numbness of the limbs slurring of speech hyperactivity restless legs facial pain tremors attention deficit disorder and brain tumours Eyes Ears blindness blurring or decreased vision bright flashes and decreased night vision pain in the eyes bulges in eyes ringing or buzzing sounds hearing loss Psychological Psychiatric depression irritability aggression anxiety personality changes insomnia phobias Chest palpitations shortness of breath high blood pressure Intestinal nausea diarrhoea abdominal pain Allergies wheezing asthma itching skin rash Aspartame and diabetes Aspartame is particularly dangerous to diabetics who unfortunately have been encouraged to use this sweetener Aspartame can precipitate diabetes worsens blood sugar control may cause diabetics to have seizures and interact badly with insulin Aspartame aggregates diabetic retinopathy damages the optic nerve and promotes blindness The free methyl alcohol it produces causes neuropathy and increases the risk of diabetics losing limbs Aspartame for weight loss Instead of a healthy dietary programme and exercise people concerned with weight loss may resort to sugar free foods sweetened with aspartame to reduce their calorie consumption Unfortunately aspartame is often associated with increased sugar cravings overeating and weight gain Items that contain AspartameAspartame is everywhere Monsanto its major manufacturer has made a huge fortune from this chemical Here is a short list of common foods that often contain it Diet soft drinks instant breakfasts breath freshener mints cereals sugar free chewing gum and candy cocoa instant teas and coffees frozen desserts gelatin desserts diet juice beverages vegetable drinks jams and jellies sugar free ketchup sugar free cookies and cakes laxatives milk drinks pharmaceutical drugs and supplements and children s vitamins sugar free shake mixes tabletop sweeteners topping mixes wine coolers yoghurt WHAT IF YOU HAVE USED ASPARTAME The most important thing is to stop exposure to the toxin Avoiding even small amounts since once sensitised to aspartame even minute amounts can produce toxicity Develop the habit to read carefully the ingredients list of everything you put in your mouth Be particularly wary of sugar free or sugarless foods and drinks I recommend the herb stevia as a sweetener Known in South America as the sweet herb stevia has been used for over four hundred years without ill effect It s twenty times sweeter than sugar so a small portion goes a long way and it is available in groceries and health food stores Once you clean up your diet your body s detoxification system particularly the liver goes into action You can greatly enhance the body s ability to detoxify by the use of specific supplements Herbs Indole 3 carbinol a natural detoxifying substance found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli cabbage Brussels sprouts and cauliflower Milk Thistle silymarin a herb shown to substantially enhance liver detoxification Curcumin an extract taken from turmeric and found in curry is another extremely powerful antioxidant that enhances detoxification Vitamins and Minerals Vitamins C B complex E magnesium and selenium all support the detoxification process Remember You are what you eat Don t dig your grave with your teeth You may email Dr Tony Vendryes at tonyvendryes gmail com or listen to An Ounce of Prevention on POWER 106FM on Fridays at 8 p m His new book An Ounce of Prevention Especially for Women is available locally and on the Internet as public awareness about the dangers of sugar has increased, many people now use artificial sweeteners to satisfy their sweet tooth... jamaica, caribbean, gleaner online, gleaner, newspapers, jamaican gleaner, news, business, sports, cricket, lead stories, cooking, entertainment, commentary,farmer's weekly,what's

The prosecution claimed that the four defendants were assisting in making copyright content available and demanded millions of dollars in damages The defense did not agree and all pleaded not guilty backed up by the inimitable King Kong defense Today Friday April 17 the court issued its decision article continuously updated The court has found that by using Pirate Bay s services there has been file sharing of music films and computer games to the extent the prosecutor has stated in his case said the district court This file sharing constitutes an unlawful transfer to the public of copyrighted performances Peter Sunde born September 13 1978 alias brokep Verdict Guilty 1 year in prison damages to pay 905 000 Peter Althin brokep s lawyer said I spoke to Peter and he wasn t very surprised A journalist he d spoken to knew an hour before it was public that all four would be convicted The verdict was leaked from the court I have to think about what effects that can have on the sentence It is unacceptable that the court is leaking Fredrik Neij born April 27 1978 alias TiAMO Verdict Guilty 1 year in prison damages to pay 905 000 Similar to the other defendants Fredrik Neij was not present to hear the verdict He currently lives in Thailand from where he manages The Pirate Bay s servers Gottfrid Svartholm October 17 1984 alias Anakata Verdict Guilty 1 year in prison damages to pay 905 000 Anakata s lawyer Ola Salomonsson said We re appealing It s very surprising that the court has chosen to treat the accused as a team Carl Lundstr\\\\u00f6m born April 13 1960 Verdict Guilty 1 year in prison damages to pay 905 000 Carl Lundstr\\\\u00f6m s verdict came as a surprise to most people since he was only remotely related to The Pirate Bay His lawyer Per E Samuelsson announced that he has already sent in his appeal and the others are expected to follow soon The court said that the four defendants worked as a team were aware that copyrighted material was being shared using The Pirate Bay and that they made it easy and assisted the infringements It categorized the infringements as severe The judge said that the users of The Pirate Bay committed the first offense by sharing files and the four assisted this It appears that the court chose to not take any of the technical details into account and only judged based on intent They find it clear that the intention of the defendants is to facilitate sharing of copyrighted works and based their verdict on this While the court did not agree with the plaintiff s exaggerated estimates of losses it still set the damages at 30 million SEK 3 620 000 This a hugely significant amount and the court has ordered that the four should pay this amount between them The judge also stated that the usage of BitTorrent at The Pirate Bay is illegal Rest assured other torrent sites hosted in Sweden will be keeping a close eye on developments The defense put it to the judge that he had folded under intense political pressure The judge denied this stating that the court made its decision based on the case presented At one point the judge was asked if he was concerned for his personal safety after handing down this decision The judge said he hadn t received any harassment and was quite surprised at the question While the judge won t be getting any flowers for this verdict Roger Wallis who spoke in favor of The Pirate Bay at their trial and received a mountain of floral tributes in return noted This will cause a flood of court cases Against all the ISPs Because if these guys assisted in copyright infringements then the ISPs also did This will have huge consequences The entire development of broadband may be stalled Peter Sunde characterized the verdict as unreal and said that he didn t expect the jail sentence He briefly spoke with Fredrik and Gottfrid and all were surprised with this outcome In response to the fines Peter said We can t pay and we wouldn t pay if we could If I would have money I would rather burn everything I owned Sunde has already explained that this decision does not mean the end of the line in this case There will be an appeal which means we are still far away from the ultimate decision possibly years away Any appeal from either side must be submitted to Sweden s higher Court by 9th May 2009 Rasmus Fleischer one of the founders of Piratbyr\\\\u00e5n commented The sentence has no formal consequence and no juridical value We chose to treat the trial as a theater play and as such it s been far better than we ever could have believed As for the fate of the site Peter has already promised that The Pirate Bay will continue The site itself was never on trial only the four individuals listed above This is a breaking news story please check back frequently for updates just minutes ago the verdict in the case of the pirate bay four was announced. all four defendants were accused of 'assisting in making copyright content available'. peter sunde: guilty. fredrik neij: guilty. gottfrid svartholm: guilty. carl lundstr\\\\u00f6m: guilty. the four receive 1 year in jail each and fines totaling $3,620,000.,url:torrentfreak

       "  u'{title:Frugal food 10 DIY tips to save money while eating better and healthier ,body:By Xeni Jardin at 8 00 am Tuesday Mar 6 Here at Boing Boing we re fond of all things handmade and of clever ways to stretch one s household budget As the cost of staple foods and happy indulgences like coffee continue to rise now is a good time to explore ways to save money on food with DIY smarts Here s a list of 10 proven ways I ve managed to cut my household budget feel free to share more of your own in the comments Also apropos of nothing Cats 1 Drink water instead of soda And drink tap water not bottled water Soft drinks don t contribute much to your body beyond chemicals and empty calories and there is growing evidence that both the sugary sweet and sugar free varieties are associated with a variety of elevated health risks Water is essential to human life Your body needs it And why waste money on bottled water that sits around in questionable plastics possibly transported from the other side of the world with a ginormous carbon footprint when the stuff that comes out of your tap is safe and healthy People who live near fracking sites in the US or in developing countries without potable tap water I m not talking to you Sink mounted water filters or filtering pitchers are an economical option if you prefer filtered water but come on quit wasting your money on bottled water It s dumb 2 Get to know your local farmer s market And eat more fresh fruits and vegetables They re nutritionally dense and an excellent use of your food budget Growers near where you live who sell in season produce are your best friend I also find that locally grown produce at the farmer s market tends to be fresher yummier and lasts longer in the fridge than what I find in stores Plus it s fun and you ll get some nice gentle exercise walking around checking out what s looking good each week 3 Prepare food at home and bring it to work instead of eating lunch out I guarantee you ll save money It s also easier to maintain a healthy nutritious calorie appropriate diet this way And I always found that preparing lunch at home was a more efficient use of my time than waiting in line with a bunch of other wage slaves during lunch rush hour 4 Font free foods are the best The less you buy in boxes the happier you ll be and the more money you ll save So many processed foods aren t really food but nutritionally lacking food like products engineered to stimulate us to eat more buy more and ensure that big food conglomerates turn a profit 5 Can you make it yourself If so you ll save money and gain flavor Salad dressings are just one example they re overpriced and underwhelming when pre packaged at the grocery but so simple to whip up at home Even a basic vinegar and oil dressing will kick bottled dressing s butt if you re using quality ingredients Feeling more ambitious Things you enjoy making and eating for some baked goods or slow cooked soup for others more exotic hobbies like home pickling can become a pleasurable and money saving habit Another simple example those single serving containers of flavored yogurt Not very economical Compare the cost per serving and the amount of sweeteners and other garbage they usually contain with buying a large tub of plain yogurt and mixing in honey nuts preserves or whatever you enjoy with each serving 6 If you eat meat consider reducing your intake of meat Try integrating more plant based proteins into your diet If this sounds crazy to you start with just one meal a week Tofu and beans generally cost less ounce to ounce than chicken beef pork lamb or fish And they need not be boring If you re new to plant based cooking the web is full of wonderful vegan vegetarian blogs and free recipe sites that can help you learn how to include these foods in your diet You don t have to become a vegetarian to enjoy them though you may decide you want to because they are yummy satisfying and nutritionally rich 7 If you drink coffee brew it yourself Buy freshly roasted whole bean coffee and grind it and brew it at home You don t need a thousand dollar espresso machine to enjoy good coffee either espresso drinks aren t inherently superior to a well done cup of drip And a cup brewed at home perhaps packed in a thermos to carry to work is cheaper and IMHO tastier to that 5 crappucino you buy every day from Starbucks 8 Start a garden If you re new to gardening start small with things you know you ll actually eat Even if you re in the city without a yard things like herbs tomatoes and lettuces can be grown in containers 9 Buy in bulk but only when it makes sense This is a good way to save money on staples like legumes nuts flours and grains in stores that offer bulk bins And Amazon and big box stores like Costco are well established sources of savings if there are packaged items you know you re going to use again and again Buying in large quantity won t save you money if you re not going to use it though See number 10 10 Waste not want not We throw away a ridiculous amount of food Ridiculous According to the EPA in 2010 more than 34 million tons of food waste was generated in America That s more than any other waste category but paper Food waste represents 14 percent of the total municipal solid waste stream making it the single largest component of trash we throw away from our homes Take a look in your kitchen trash can how much of that is food Can you do more to reduce the amount of usable food you throw out with better meal planning and less impulsive eating out Think of your frugal ancestors and how little they likely wasted compared to us today What would your great grandmother do Eat what you buy and buy only what you will eat images Shutterstock Where not

trends to watch for | online college tips &#8211; online colleges,body:Teachers and administrators have been bringing technology into the classroom for decades now but with the advent of cloud computing and the proliferation of smaller more portable computers and Internet capable devices it s now possible to bring the classroom into the technology instead Mobile learning sometimes abbreviated to M Learning focuses on learning through mobile devices allowing learners to move about in a classroom or remotely learn from any location of their choice It s a movement that s gained a lot of steam in recent years and despite some criticisms isn t like to fade fast especially as new technologies that make mobile learning more practical continue to emerge and the popularity of remote learning opportunities like online colleges continue to grow Whether you re a teacher or a student you ve undoubtedly heard talk about mobile learning and may be wondering what it means for the future of education whether in grade school colleges or the workplace While the applications of M Learning are growing all the time we ve highlighted some of the major trends here to help you learn more about how mobile learning is shaping the 21st century classroom and may change how we teach learn and interact in any educational environment Location based integration Mobile learning has taken to the streets with technologies that allow for seamless integration with a wide range of locations One of the best uses of this technology has been within museums where visitors can use a mobile device to listen to information about items in the museum s collection The American Museum of Natural History in New York is one museum with an especially rich mobile tool guiding users turn by turn to the best pieces in the museum s collection and enhancing the experience of visiting Of course mobile integration isn t just for museums Some colleges are using it to create high tech tours for visiting students and their families With millions of smartphone users and the number growing larger each year this trend is likely to grow as more businesses and organizations work enrich patron experience Online class management Online class management systems like Moodle and Blackboard have grown exponentially in their number of users in recent years Part of the popularity stems from the ability to not only access and update student records from a computer but from mobile devices like a phone or an iPad as well Students teachers and parents alike can easily check grades upload assignments and check on homework through the assessment tools making them not only more accessible but more practical for anyone involved in the educational process The domination of ebooks Amazon com is one of the biggest retailers of books but in the past year their sales of ebooks has outstripped that of traditional books The same holds true for bookselling giant Barnes and Noble The ebook is steadily becoming a popular part of everyday life for so many Americans and the digital book is slowly making its way into the classroom as well Some states like California have proposed replacing student textbooks with ebooks Not only could it be a big money saver it may help eliminate the problem of student textbooks becoming quickly outdated as new discoveries are made something every teacher and child can appreciate Cloud computing in schools These days cloud computing is a pretty big buzzword with big tech companies like Microsoft and Apple pushing their devices and applications and schools haven t ignored the hype Schools are increasingly looking to cloud computing as a way to provide access to information and to close budget gaps An inexpensive solution cloud computing is becoming the norm everywhere from grade schools to grad schools perhaps because it is not only simple to use but mobile as well Information on the cloud whether its lesson plans or class projects can be accessed from anywhere anytime and on any mobile device In an increasingly mobile world and classroom cloud computing is more than just a trend and is likely to become the standard in information management over the next decade Bring your own device classrooms Since most kids these days already have access to a mobile device schools are seizing the opportunity to turn these gadgets from distractions into learning tools by incorporating these devices into classroom lessons and projects From mobile phones to laptop computers teachers and students are increasingly bringing technology to the classroom and in many school districts it s being put to good use Numerous studies have highlighted the benefits of one to one computing programs in raising test scores and increasing college attendance but with many districts strapped for cash and unable to provide devices for each student this isn t always a possibility The solution may be found in asking students to bring their own devices to class cutting back on the number of mobile devices the school needs to provide while still enhancing the learning experience Online collaborative learning There aren t a lot of places these days that are devoid of an Internet connection and many people can now access the web from well anywhere they can get a cell phone signal Schools are embracing the web as a learning tool in a variety of ways but one particularly exciting one has been the growth of online collaborative learning This can mean a variety of things but in many cases it involves students each participating in a project on the web Numerous classrooms have taken to collaboratively blogging about projects and ideas in the classroom Others have produced their own podcasts Still others ask students to work together to create a multimedia website These kinds of projects not only help students learn to work together but educate them on technological tools they ll need to use in their academic and professional lives The popularity of these kinds of lessons isn t likely to fade anytime soon The rise of the tablet Tablet computers come in many shapes and sizes but as they grow smaller and more portable they are becoming a fairly common addition to the American classroom The iPad has been one such tablet device that has shown a lot of popularity and promise in recent years in the classroom Great for doing everything from studying the periodic table to playing educational games the app based device has been a big trend in schools across the nation with many shelling out millions to provide students with access to the devices While some debate the effectiveness of tablet computers as a learning tool experimentation with them in the classroom has had largely positive results from both teachers and students Social media for education When it was first created Facebook was solely a place for college students to connect with one another Today just about everyone has a profile on the site and it s being used for a lot more than just rehashing weekend parties In facts many professors have begun using it as a way to connect with students spark discussion and relay important assignment information With the majority of college students able to access the site from their phones or other mobile devices students have no excuse not to get involved in class no matter where they are or how busy they may be While social media in education is still tricky territory as sites like Twitter and Facebook evolve the ways they re used in the classroom will likely become more refined and potentially more powerful in creating a better educational experience Snack learning One of the criticisms of the digital generation is that they have short attention spans However true or untrue this may be educators are taking note and developing learning tools that offer up snack sized bits of learning for students on the go These single serve educational bites may make it easier for students to tackle the ever increasing amount of information they need to know from mastering a programming language to learning the basics of American history and just about everything in between Mobile devices are a perfect extension of this concept allowing learners to engage in short bursts of learning while waiting in line on the bus or sitting on the couch Mobile learning in workplace training Mobile learning isn t just catching on in schools and colleges it s also becoming a part of the workplace training experience as well providing information and a new format for testing understanding With many businesses already supplying workers with smartphones for work it makes sense to get the most out of these devices as possible One way companies are doing this is by having experts share their expertise either through blogs or a series of podcasts Additionally mobile devices are an excellent source of reference information should an employee ever encounter a situation with which he or she isn t familiar Performance support for employees can help reinforce their training and make for a stronger more confident workforce something every business is undoubtedly looking to establish July 5th 2011 written

       "  u\"{title:How to Avoid Spots on Icing ,body:Decorating cookies in the summer can be a nightmare if you don t know some key tips Have you ever spent hours making your cookies and lovingly decorating them only to find hours later that the cookies have splotches or spots on the icing I ve received numerous emails from you imploring for help with this mysterious issue While it has rarely happened to me and I ll explain why in a minute many of you have shared your photos with me and we ve worked together to try and resolve the issue So I m writing today to hopefully help prevent it from happening to you or if it has happened to you to share with you how to avoid it again Why are there spots on the icing I mentioned that this issue rarely happens to me Well I ve figured out that it rarely happens because I live in area which only experiences real humidity during the months of June August It does seems to be humidity which is the real culprit I m no scientist and would love to hear from you if you have more theories and or information but it seems like somehow the fat from the cookie i e butter seeps into the royal icing I m guessing that it happens more when the cookies are drying in a warm humid area because the butter isn t as solid and melts up into the icing Take for example these owl cookies I made in early May Although we were experiencing a warm spell here I decided not to buy a new de humidifier more on that coming later to make these cookies My de humidifier broke at the end of last summer and I guess I just hoped the cookies would be fine Well even though it was early May it was humid and the base of little guys ended up getting spots As soon as I noticed splotches on a few cookies I was off to Walmart to buy a dehumidifier so only the base layer ended up getting the spots I decided that the brown kind of looked textured with spots well hoped really as I didn t have time to start them over Oh terrible confession Jenn and her mom seemed to love them though Before I shared with you what I did to prevent this from happening again I wanted to test the theory out I picked the colours which are most likely to get spots and to bleed darks such as red navy and very light colours such as white and pale yellow and made summer cookies No spots No bleeding Yay So what exactly do you do to prevent this from happening to you How to Avoid Getting Spots on Your Cookies 1 De humidifier and Air Conditioner The most important solution work in a room with a dehumidifier and air conditioner I work in a room with the windows and doors shut and with the de humidifier and and air conditioner on Even though the air conditioner has a de humidify function on it our summers are so humid here that I find I need an extra de humidifier as well Here s a pic of the pretty dehumidifier I have If you re not able to purchase an air conditioner or de humidifier there are a few things which will help 2 Colour your white icing white It may seem redundant but besides making the icing look whiter and fresher it really seems to hide small spots if they tend to appear 3 Make your icing thicker The consistency of the icing seems to make a difference It seems the spots can permeate through thinner icing easier Watch a video tutorial on icing consistency here 4 Cookie thickness If you make your cookies on the thicker side and it s something you don t mind changing bake them so they re approximately 1 cm or 1 3 of an inch thick 5 Use a good royal icing recipe I love Antonia74 s recipe It s creamy and velvety If you d like to try it you can find it here 6 Let the icing on your cookies dry at room temperature When you enclose your cookies in an air tight container the humidity moisture in the container will affect the icing Once the icing is dry you can seal the cookies in tupperware gift bags etc 7 Bake your cookies a little bit longer If your cookies are bit underdone or soft the fat in your cookie seems to affect the icing with splotches more If you do like your cookies soft though solution 1 should work More to Discuss That being said there are questions which have stumped me when it comes to the cookie spotting issue For example Pamela of Adventures in Biscuits wanted to know why only her purple poodle cookie got the spots Could it be that the type brand of food gel coloring makes a difference I personally really like using Americolor because they have easy to dispense squeeze bottles and I find the colours bleed less Pamela has since emailed me and mentioned she found the spots happened less with the Wilton brand There are so many variables what has been your experience Do you have any favorite decorating tips for working in a warm or humid environment There s much more to learn so I d love to hear from you on my facebook page here on twitter you tube or in the comment section below Happy spot less decorating xo Marian p s Some of the summer themed cookies for example the flip flops and shorts are copied from Martha Stewart Crafts stickers I noticed on facebook that there were requests on how I made them I will do them again and take pictures but for now How to Make the Flip Flop Cookies a Pipe outline of flip flop base I used a projector but you might not need to and fill in right away For the dotted ones pipe the dots right away wet on wet technique b Once the base is dry pipe the white straps c To make the gum paste flower you ll need this small flower plunger cutter and gum paste Here s a tutorial on making gum paste leaves Follow the same directions d Once the flower is dry pipe a little yellow dot for the center and adhere it to the flip flop with a little royal icing Done p s s Tried making two versions of the sand castle cookies one with brown sugar on top and one just royal icing If you end up making these know that the flag breaks off very easily p s s s If you d like to never miss a post and or receive more tips on cookie decorating click on this

       "  u\"{title:The No Knead Bread Amateur Gourmet ,body:December 18 2008 By Adam Roberts 56 Comments If you haven t heard about the no knead bread by now you clearly don t read many food blogs or newspapers for that matter Last year in The New York Times actually TWO years ago in The New York Times the article was published November 8 2006 Boy I m way behind on making this Mark Bittman coaxed a recipe from master bread baker Jim Lahey for perfect bakery quality bread at home Shockingly the recipe required no work no kneading of any kind The food world was astonished Food bloggers went ga ga I watched them go ga ga And finally last week I decided to go ga ga myself Really it just came down to an impulse At midnight last Friday night I pulled up the recipe online and wrote down the following 3 cups all purpose or bread flour 1 4 teaspoon instant yeast 1 1 4 teaspoons salt I went into the kitchen and mixed those things together Then as directed by the recipe I added 1 5 8ths cups of water which is really just a little more than 1 5 cups of water and stirred just until blended Dough will be shaggy and sticky said the recipe That was it I covered it with plastic wrap and went to sleep I spent the next day frolicking in the meadow and healing the sick and when I was ready for bread approximately 7 PM Saturday night I looked back at my bowl and saw this It had risen And it smelled oh so good and yeasty Note just so you have the actual timing of this it should rest for at least 12 hours preferably 18 That s why I did everything the night before The next step is to flour a work surface That s a pretty easy step Then you plop the dough from the bowl on to the work surface and you sprinkle it with a little more flour Then you fold it over on itself once or twice Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest 15 minutes Finally you use a little more flour so the dough doesn t stick and shape it into a ball You coat a cotton towel with flour or cornmeal I used cornemal place the dough seam side down on the towel and dust with more cornmeal Then you cover with another towel and let rest for 2 more hours 2 more hours I should ve read this carefully I was getting hungry But I did more frolicking more healing of the sick and 2 hours later this is what I had Looks good already doesn t it Now the fun dangerous part 30 minutes before the 2 hours are up so 1 hour and 30 minutes into the dough s final rise place a 6 8 quart heavy covered pot cast iron enamel Pyrex or ceramic in the oven and heat to 450 At the 2 hour mark when the pot s been in there 30 minutes carefully VERY CAREFULLY remove the scalding hot pot from the oven lift the lid off and dump the dough in seam side up To quote the recipe It may look like a mess but that is ok Shake the pan to evenly distribute and it ll look something like this Here s where the magic happens You put the lid on carefully that lid is hot too and place back in the oven for half an hour Then you remove the lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes until the loaf is beautifully browned I can t tell you how good this made the apartment smell It had a toasty caramelly bready bakery smell that should be bottled and sold instead of Fabreeze You already know from the picture at the top of the post what the bread looked like when it came out of the oven but I want to show you again Isn t that a beauty Painters don t you want to paint that Composers don t you want to write a song about that Accountants don t you want to do its taxes You remove carefully to a rack to let it cool and it was hard not to tear in and eat it right away but the blasting heat of the bread was a good deterrent Finally 15 20 minutes later I cut in and this is what I saw The bread was surprisingly pliant breads I ve made in the past have been much tougher on the outside This tore and cut easily and the first bite was everything I wanted it to be warm only slightly chewy and crusty and nutty on the outside with a certain sweetness and freshness that only comes from getting the bread straight from the oven So let s review to make brilliant bakery quality bread that makes you go ga ga all you need to do is mix 3 things together before you go to bed add water like a Gremlin and the next night you ll have fresh bread You have no excuse I had no excuse The time is right for you to make the no knead bread To quote Nike Just do it Related Recipes Make Bread Luisa s Potato Focaccia Pa amb Tom\\\\u00e0quet Easy French Toast Tags baking bread Jim Lahey Mark Bittman Categories Bread and Pizza Recipes if you haven't heard about the no-knead bread by now, you clearly don't read many food blogs (or newspapers, for that matter.) last year, in the new yo,url:amateurgourmet 2008 12 the noknead bre html}\",\n",

       "  u\"{title:Caramel Baked Doughnuts Namely Marly ,body:It s National Doughnut Day and that s not a day too soon for these Caramel Glazed Baked Donuts adorned with melted dark chocolate If that s not a way to celebrate this national day of doughnuts I don t know what is It s the first Friday of the month of June That makes it National Doughnut Day It s a day worthy of celebration if you ask me Which I know you didn t but I just feel the need to tell you anyway And since I m telling you things I guess I should tell you this too I have never been one for doughnuts I remember a job I had after my freshmen year in college Everyone used to contribute money to a fund throughout the week and someone would go out on Friday mornings and bring in doughnuts It s not that I never contributed and participated in the eating I just wasn t happy about it And on the days I didn t participate in that doughnut fund I would eye the box sitting on the break room counter With that shiny coat of glaze dancing in the light from the break room window those doughnuts seemed almost magical Come have one they would call to me like my own personal siren call Homer had beautiful maidens I have doughnuts Go figure Nope I can t I would respond To myself of course I didn t want anyone thinking I was crazy We re soooo good Oh I know you are I surely do But I m no fool to the allure of doughnuts They sing a lovely song but they offer me nothing but immediate and long lasting discomfort I feel plain awful after I eat them Too bad chocolate doesn t have that kind of impact on me And peanut butter for that matter I d be as skinny as a rake I figured out over the years that it was the combination of the grease and sugar that did me in That s why I was so excited to buy this special doughnut pan The kind that lets you bake the doughnuts Whoever thought of that was surely a genius Well maybe that s a bit of a stretch But whoever it was they re good as gold in my book So now I get to celebrate National Doughnut Day with the rest of the world You can t see me but I m doing a little happy jig in the kitchen It s a great day I stay away from gluten these days as well so I ve provided a gluten free option too No one puts gluten free baby in a corner So Happy National Doughnut Day Caramel Glazed Baked Donuts Ingredients 1 cup flour 1 teaspoon yeast \\\\u00bd teaspoon baking powder 1 tablespoon corn starch 1 tablespoon flax seed meal 3 tablespoons water 6 tablespoons sugar \\\\u00bc cup margarine \\\\u00bd cup soy buttermilk 1 teaspoon vanilla Caramel Glaze Frosting See recipe below Chocolate Topping See recipe below Make this gluten free by using 1 2 cup brown rice flour 1 4 cup buckwheat flour 1 4 cup white rice flour or a gluten free flour blend Directions Heat your oven to 350F and coat a baked donut pan with vegetable spray Place flour yeast baking powder and salt in a medium bowl stir and set aside In a small bowl combine the corn starch flax meal and water Stir until the ingredients are combined and set aside for the ingredients to thicken In a food processor add the margarine and sugar Pulse a few seconds until they re mixed together Then add the corn starch mixture and pulse again until combined Then add the soy buttermilk and vanilla and pulse again until everything is combined Combination is key Now add your flour mixture to the food processor and pulse a few more seconds until your dough is formed It should be a thin sticky kind of dough Is that the best kind or what Now you re going to want to pour the batter into each doughnut

       "  u'{title:The Jets of the Future TechFlesh ,body:NASA asked the world s top aircraft engineers to solve the hardest problem in commercial aviation how to fly cleaner quieter and using less fuel The prototypes they imagined may set a new standard for the next two decades of flight BOX WING JET LOCKHEED MARTIN Target Date 2025Passenger jets consume a lot of fuel A Boeing 747 burns five gallons of it every nautical mile and as the price of that fuel rises so do fares Lockheed Martin engineers developed their Box Wing concept to find new ways to reduce fuel burn without abandoning the basic shape of current aircraft Adapting the lightweight materials found in the F 22 and F 35 fighter jets they designed a looped wing configuration that would increase the lift to drag ratio by 16 percent making it possible to fly farther using less fuel while still fitting into airport gates They also ditched conventional turbofan engines in favor of two ultrahigh bypass turbofan engines Like all turbofans they generate thrust by pulling air through a fan on the front of the engine and by burning a fuel air mixture in the engine s core With fans 40 percent wider than those used now the Box Wing s engines bypass the core at several times the rate of current engines At subsonic speeds this arrangement improves efficiency by 22 percent Add to that the fuel saving boost of the box wing configuration and the plane is 50 percent more efficient than the average airliner The additional wing lift also lets pilots make steeper descents over populated areas while running the engines at lower power Those changes could reduce noise by 35 decibels and shorten approaches by up to 50 percent Andrew Rosenblum SUPERSONIC GREEN MACHINE LOCKHEED MARTIN Target Date 2030The first era of commercial supersonic transportation ended on November 26 2003 with the final flight of the Concorde a noisy inefficient and highly polluting aircraft But the dream of a sub three hour cross country flight lingered and in 2010 designers at Lockheed Martin presented the Mach 1 6 Supersonic Green Machine The plane s variable cycle engines would improve efficiency by switching to conventional turbofan mode during takeoff and landing Combustors built into the engine would reduce nitrogen oxide pollution by 75 percent And the plane s inverted V tail and under wing engine placement would nearly eliminate the sonic booms that led to a ban on overland Concorde flights The configuration mitigates the waves of air pressure caused by the collision with air of a plane traveling faster than Mach 1 that combine into the enormous shock waves that produce sonic booms The whole idea of low boom design is to control the strength position and interaction of shock waves says Peter Coen the principal investigator for supersonic projects at NASA Instead of generating a continuous loop of loud booms the plane would issue a dull roar that from the ground would be about as loud as a vacuum cleaner Andrew Rosenblum SUGAR VOLT BOEING Target Date 2035The best way to conserve jet fuel is to turn off the gas engines That s only possible with an alternative power source like the battery packs and electric motors in the Boeing SUGAR Volt s hybrid propulsion system The 737 size 3 500 nautical mile range plane would draw energy from both jet fuel and batteries during takeoff but once at cruising altitude pilots could switch to all electric mode see Volta Volare GT4 At the same time Boeing engineers were rethinking propulsion they also rethought wing design By making the wing thinner and the span greater you can produce more lift with less drag says Marty Bradley Boeing s principal investigator on the project The oversize wings would fold up so pilots could access standard boarding gates Together the high lift wings the hybrid powertrain and the efficient open rotor engines would make the SUGAR Volt 55 percent more efficient than the average airliner The plane would emit 60 percent less carbon dioxide and 80 percent less nitrous oxide Additionally the extra boost the hybrid system provides at takeoff would enable pilots to use runways as short as 4 000 feet For most planes landing requires less space than takeoff A 737 needs a minimum of 5 000 feet for takeoff so the SUGAR Volt could bring cross country flights to smaller airports Rose Pastore Source the jets of the future technology, jets, future, design, amazing, ,amazing,design,future,jets,url:techflesh the jets of the future}',\n",

cause it was giving me grief The metal spirals that we used for boning were too long and I had to get my boyfriends father to trim them for me urrrg Anyway here is a few piccies of it along with some photos of an Edwardian Petticoat we did earlier in the year That drove me nuts with almost 50 metres in total of pintucks and 21 metres of cording in the hem I have to go buy another length of lacing for the corset cause this one is too short In the class we are taking now we also create a bustle and we use this and our corset in third year I m first year to build our bustle outfits over Here is some pictures of the most AMAZING bustle I got to parade for a third year at our annual show Please note the garment isn t mine I just got to wear it Another student made the entire thing including the hat Another note these pictures do belong to me so I promise I m not breaking any copyright rules vintageburlesque OfflinePosts 161Joined 10 Oct 2007 If I stop sewing I will cease to live Your work in progress is gorgeous and will be worth the finish And the Edwardian dress is beautiful as is the hat I m assuming it took many hours of hard and patient work to put that together When I make a

said this before but still we have ALL been there where we realized there was no Jif and no Diet Coke and nothing in the house with salt in it and PEOPLE SHOULD NOT LIVE LIKE THAT and so we ran out to Ralph s with no regard to what we had on or whether we had shaved our legs It s just life However we don t usually do any of those things in sweatpants overalls Photo INFDaily com And I might even have let this slide as an off day yes I DO realize she s carrying a Nobu bag but the image provider caption claims she was using it as a purse so yeah never mind it s still weird if Lily hadn t recently caused a stir in Cannes by getting so drunk she couldn t hold up her head It s all making me wonder if the booze and the peroxide are seeping into her mind somehow and she s become convinced she s a nine year old circa about 1987 who believes she s going to grow up to marry Richard Marx and that they will hire an entire STAFF of people who are to do nothing but make sure her romper legs are rolled up evenly Also correct me if I m wrong but isn t Jay Manuel a walking testimonial to the perils of turning your hair an alien silver hue Please tell me his common sense did not die in vain

portrait of herself shoved under the bed doing all the aging for her Because she looks about six months older than she did that time she cracked her head on the side of the Melrose Place pool and then proceeded to haunt Billy for like 36 hours until she got bored That was twelve years ago You know just in case you were feeling spry At the very least her moisturizer deserves a high five Or even a

to escape our microscope Nicole Kidman taught us all a lot of valuable lessons about fair skin and blonde hair and white dresses that look like nightgowns I wish Cynthia had been paying attention She

love Sarah Jessica Parker s dress I know it looks a tiny bit like spacesuit material or that it s been covered in cling film but she just looks so pretty in it Everyone is watching why NOT go big right There are photos where she s walking around while playing with the skirt and stretching it out and dammit I would do the exact same thing if I were Princess For A Day in that gown Incidentally I would also take Matthew aside and be all Listen Ferris would it KILL YOU to act like you are proud to be with me His left meathook is plopped onto her waist like it s radioactive and his facial expression is saying to me Shoot there s that girl whose best friend s sister s boyfriend s brother s girlfriend who heard from the guy who knows this kid who s going with the girl who saw me pass out

mail this fug Fug or Fab Ashley Olsen I do at least get what Ashley Olsen was going for here Photo Splash News but I can t help feeling like she might have pulled off the whole female tuxedo thing better if she d say washed her hair And removed and replaced last night s eye shadow And not worn the cummerbund And hemmed the pants And picked a blazer that fit Or say not picked a blazer at all She seems to be aiming at business chic but jerked her arm at the last minute and hit the exhausted blackjack dealer at The Champagne Pit spot on the target instead But you know she s an Olsen Should she get points for having a clear intent that doesn t involve evoking the homeless Do we give points for that sort of thing Personally I don t like grading on a curve But I know a lot of people who d have flunked freshman chemistry without one so let s give it a whirl here Posted by Heather at 11 20 AM in Fug or Fab Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen Permalink E mail this fug Fugsip Girl So for those of you who don t watch Gossip Girl Lydia Hearst here showed up in the final episode as the highly unrealistic impetus for smitten skeeze Chuck Bass to ditch out on Blair Waldorf and screw his way back into ill repute Aside from him doing a total 180 in the span of five minutes of TV thereby making it feel slightly pointless to get him together with Blair in the first place it was also a really unsatisfying ending and totally unrealistic because seriously Blair Waldorf could eat this chick for lunch if Blair Waldorf ate anything but yogurt I mean that corset looks like the rat traps all got set off before Cinderella s party posse finished making her dress Should this ever happen to you and really who hasn t had their army of tiny tailors accidentally tempted by fatal peanut butter traps my advice is to wear something else rather than divert attention from your unfinished bodice by attaching every piece of costume jewelry within a two mile radius to your boobs and then hoping for the best Maybe this is a spoiler for next season maybe Lydia s character returns and Blair Waldorf exacts sweet hot glue revenge on her entire wardrobe And then I pray packs her off with Georgina Sparks to that reform school never to be seen again The lesson here Do not fondle Chuck s turtlenecks or you WILL pay Posted by Heather at 10 47 AM Permalink E mail this fug Sex Fug the City You guys I think

Today about 90 seconds from opening my door to find Kim Cattrall standing there to personally remind me to pre order my tickets a minute from Cynthia Nixon appearing as a vision on the back of my morning Pop Tart and approximately 10 seconds from Sarah Jessica Parker ripping open my shower curtain while I m in the middle of deep conditioning to inform me that Carrie Bradshaw s story isn t over yet I KNOW I KNOW THE MOVIE IS COMING OUT I SWEAR I WILL GO SEE IT LEAVE ME ALONE GOD It seems however that Giuliana DePandi Rancic is feeling no such tiresome waves of ennui She was so stoked to find out what happened with Mr Big that she ran out to the premiere without even noticing that she s totally covered in toilet paper I feel like that has got to go against all the tips in her dating book Did you know Giuliana has written a dating book by the way I didn t either but the internet has set me straight Apparently it s called Think Like a Guy How to Get a Guy by Thinking Like One and while

about all these photos is how totally uninterested the photographers behind her are If you look at pictures of like Angelina and Brad ALL photographers within a ten mile radius are screaming hard enough to induce a stroke These guys are thinking about lunch Or maybe just looking away from her kissy face because they ve heard the old French proverb If P Squared thee kiss thy wallet ye will miss How else do you think she affords the vast amount of patterned silk required for her Cannes wardrobe It s all artful pickpocketry of one kind or another This one is just eye crossing but I must applaud her artful use of the bikini top at a red carpet event Clearly she s avoiding the bottoms due to recent bathing suit related traumas But this though she clearly should be commended for artful

Dare To Fug Me I m pleased Lindsay Lohan is apparently booking a few jobs that give me headline material for whenever we want to feature her And I think I m supposed to settle for being pleased that she is not wearing leggings here However I m distinctly NOT pleased that she s forsaken the Spandex Scourge in favor of looking like somebody dug her out of their attic shampooed her and then brought her to Antiques Roadshow to find out if Marie Antoinette ever sat on her at a state dinner I would suggest that maybe her mom could stop gallivanting around being gross and trying to turn her youngest kid into a new meal ticket but alas I m pretty sure Dina s influence would only cause Linds to streak on some leg bronzer and throw on some even CLUMSIER makeup all part of the Lohan Matriarch s effort to make sure her kids look so prematurely old that she could pass as their younger sister Sigh Maybe Lindsay learned her lesson about unflatteringly short skirts when she wasn t allowed to sit down anywhere without a cater waiter performing a panty check however in the wrong hands that could be interpreted as a dating strategy so I should probably just give up hope and go meditate on lunch

       "  u'{title:Tofu vs Hotdog Charting the Evolution of the American Diet Over Time With Google s Latest Gadget Food ,body:Google Labs has just released the Google Books N Gram Viewer and it is fun I have to confess to not really understanding the fine mathematical detail behind the term n gram but the resulting graphs simply show the frequency with which words occur within the Google Books database over time You can look when and how fast individual words spike and subside in popularity as well as compare how different words fare against each other in a reflection of larger linguistic and social changes The San Jose Mercury News rounds up some examples of Google Books N Gram Viewer uses and findings from detecting trends in censorship to the pace at which the past is being forgotten Trends in censorship can be identified through counts of names For example Jewish artist Marc Chagall was mentioned just once in the entire German body of literature from 1936 to 1944 even as his prominence in English language books grew roughly fivefold Similar suppression is seen in Russian with regard to Leon Trotsky in Chinese with regard to Tiananmen Square and in the U S with regard to the Hollywood Ten a group of entertainers blacklisted in 1947 Books forget our past faster with each passing year The Harvard Google team tracked the frequency with which each year from 1875 to 1975 appeared and found that references to the past decrease much more rapidly now than in the 19th century References to 1880 didn t fall by half until 1912 a lag of 32 years but references to 1973 reached half their peak just a decade later in 1983 The Google s engineers and Harvard linguists behind the project have described their approach and the resulting insights as a new science of culturomics which they define as the application of high throughput data collection and analysis to the study of human culture As an example the Ngram View landing page shows a pre generated chart comparing tofu and hot dog occurrences in books published since 1920 both increase but tofu races past hot dog in the early 1980s Thus encouraged I compared all sort of food words to see what culturomics has to teach us about the American diet in print The slideshow above is the tip of the iceberg be warned that it is extremely addictive google labs has just released the google books n-gram viewer, and it is fun!,url:good is post tofu vs hotdog charting the evolution of the american diet over time with google s latest gadget}',\n",

       "  u\"{title:Creme Brulee Ice Cream gfe gluten free easily ,body:July 27th 2010 This post is linked to Gluten Free Wednesdays Food on Friday Foodie Friday and Slightly Indulgent Tuesdays I admit it I was going to cheat a bit on my entry for this month s Go Ahead Honey It s Gluten Free If you re not familiar Go Ahead Honey is the longstanding gluten free blog carnival invented by sweet and creative Naomi Devlin over at Straight Into Bed Cakefree and Dried Each month the carnival is hosted by a different blogger who chooses the theme I had the honor of hosting last summer with the theme Make Me A Happy Camper This month s hostess is Sheryl of Breaking Bread Her theme is Ooh La La Bastille Day which of course means the entries should be recipes for French food How was I going to cheat with my entry Well I made a sort of French dish the other night but I didn t have to go across the pond for it It was Catfish Etouffee a French Cajun dish that turned out very well But I ll have to share it another time because it was actually after making the etouffee that true inspiration hit Suddenly I knew what I really wanted to make cr\\\\u00e8me brulee After all it s my favorite dessert and it s a classic French recipe Julia Child and all that I realized that thoughts of making cr\\\\u00e8me brulee have been forming in my brain for quite some time It started subconsciously when I first tasted coconut sugar I was so surprised by its caramel butterscotch flavor and its slightly crunchy texture I fell in love on my first bite and that was before I discovered the depth of flavor it can add to desserts So coconut sugar and its application to cr\\\\u00e8me brulee were bound to reach my conscious state eventually To be clear I didn t actually want to make cr\\\\u00e8me brulee itself The amazing dessert that comes in lovely little ramekins It s the dessert that can decide if a restaurant is a good one or a great one in my book No I didn t want that cr\\\\u00e8me brulee I wanted cr\\\\u00e8me brulee ice cream with that rich creamy caramelized brown sugar taste and I wanted to make it without eggs Frankly I just don t have the patience for ice cream recipes where you have to cook the ingredients temper the eggs and usually chill the results for several hours or overnight It s that whole easily thing you know And there are always my egg free gfe readers to consider too I knew I d add full fat coconut milk and vanilla extract in addition to the coconut sugar Then I decided to add half of a vanilla bean as I had one on hand But I knew I needed more thickness and lusciousness to turn the ingredients into creme brulee ice cream After I thought about the possibilities the answer was clear and easy too Condensed milk One can readily purchase condensed milk or make one s own even a dairy free version See notes in recipe I cheated and picked some up a can of condensed milk at the little family owned store I frequent So I didn t make this particular recipe dairy free I started measuring mixing caramelizing and after about a half hour the ice cream was finished It was glorious Yes glorious Or c est magnifique And somehow I just knew it would be With the beater dripping ice cream into a large bowl and a big spoon in hand I headed to our bedroom where Mr GFE was relaxing He eyed me suspiciously as he looked up from the movie he was watching Me offering a big spoonful of ice cream Taste Mr GFE scowling looking first at me and the large bowl and then back at the television screen Is that French Me momentarily confused and then looking at the screen on which Entre Acte was displayed Yes it can sort of mean intermission between acts Taste Mr GFE What is it Me impatiently Just taste please It s cr\\\\u00e8me brulee ice cream I need your opinion Mr GFE no longer frowning eyes bright Uhhmmm Is that French Me Yes cr\\\\u00e8me brulee is French Mr GFE No on the tv Me looking at the television again and frowning upon seeing Entre Acte still displayed Yes I just told you that It basically means intermission Mr GFE shrugs Sorry I got distracted by the ice cream What is it again Me somewhat patiently The words on the screen or the ice cream Mr GFE The ice cream Me as I am exiting the room Cr\\\\u00e8me brulee Do you like it Mr GFE did not answer Instead he followed me into the kitchen and grabbed a spoon to dig into the beater bowl of ice cream himself Mr GFE emphatically That s not ice cream That s custard Me It s really good isn t it Mr GFE with his mouth full nods Me Well yes it does taste like frozen custard but custard is made with eggs and this has no eggs Have you noticed that we discuss semantics a lot in our house Food semantics to be specific Cake or bread here and here Pizza or casserole Mr GFE still eating I m very liberal with the amount that stays on the beater and ends up in the tasting bowl Now how are you going to show people how good this is Me With my photos of course Mr GFE shaking his head You can t show them how good this is you just can t They have to taste it Where did you get the recipe Me smiling I made it up Mr GFE eating another giant spoonful doubtfully You made this up Really Me smiling even wider Yep Pretty good stuff huh Mr GFE still eating nodding Yeah Pretty good Me What movie is that you re watching I knew it wasn t a high brow French art film or anything similar so I was curious Mr GFE How the West Was Won Me my turn to be doubtful Really Why would How the West Was Won have displays in French Mr GFE shrugs eats the last bite of ice cream in the bowl I don t know Enough of our bantering and Who s on First routines that go on pretty much non stop in the gfe household You ll want to make this recipe but it is not one to make when you re home alone Consider yourself forewarned I had to take half of it to work today as a way to impose some self discipline Because as much as Mr GFE loves it he s also the type to decline when I offer it to him the next night and come back a week later and ask May I have some more of that great ice cream Yeah like it s still going to be around a week later Clearly we have different genes and jeans He s wearing the same size jeans 34 x 34 that he wore when we met so many years ago After we got married and he was no longer eating bachelor cooking he was on his way to gaining 20 pounds He was going to have to move uh up to the next size of jeans He refused to do it So he stopped eating third and fourth helpings yes you read that correctly and soon his jeans were fitting perfectly well again Sigh Now do you know why I say my marriage is a love hate relationship Oh and what did my friends at work think of this ice cream Well only two got to try it Here s what they said Sherry expression of incredulity Ooohhh That is so good What s in it It s so creamy I could eat that whole container Then when she ate some more later she emailed me All I can say is CREAMY DELISH GOODNESS I m glad this is all you brought in cuz I could eat 10 gallons of it AWSUM delicious I tell you Tavie It s really good I think it tastes like toasted coconut but I don t eat cr\\\\u00e8me brulee often so I m not a good one to say about the cr\\\\u00e8me brulee flavor They both tasted the coconut flavor Neither I nor Mr GFE taste any coconut flavor but maybe that s because we re used to coconut milk as a non dairy milk substitute Here s the recipe Cr\\\\u00e8me Brulee Ice Cream Gluten Free Egg Free with Dairy Free Vegan Option Click here for a printable version of this recipe just under 2 \\\\u00bc cups full fat coconut milk chilled1 can condensed milk see homemade versions including dairy free options in this post from Heidi Adventures of a Gluten Free Mom and here at Alisa s Go Dairy Free site 1 cup coconut sugar1 tsp vanilla extractscrapings from half a vanilla bean Mix all together in a large bowl with hand mixer Pour into frozen ice cream tub Churn 25 to 30 minutes As soon as ice cream starts churning start making brulee sugar as shown below It doesn t take long to make but you will want to chill it as directed which does take several minutes Brulee Sugar for Swirling In 1 2 tbsp oil coconut or grapeseed oil 3 tbsp coconut sugar1 tbsp coconut cream In a small skillet heat oil on medium heat until warm Add coconut sugar Stir constantly for a few minutes until coconut sugar is a little crunchy Stir in about a tablespoon of the coconut cream the thick cream at the top of the can after refrigerating for a long period of time or a little less of some full fat coconut milk as a binder Stir Place skillet in freezer until 5 minutes before the ice cream will be finished churning Remove skillet and break up brulee sugar if necessary with wooden spoon While ice cream is still churning using wooden spoon knock brulee sugar pieces into ice cream maker a little at a time Wait until each piece disappears before you add the next one so you ll have brulee sugar deposits spread throughout your ice cream Transfer ice cream to a freezer container and freeze a bit longer if needed Shirley s Notes When making the brulee sugar I recommend only using grapeseed oil which is flavorless or coconut oil as a second choice when making the brulee sugar Other oils may be too strong and negatively impact the cr\\\\u00e8me brulee flavor After scraping vanilla bean don t discard it You can add it to a container of granulated sugar to make vanilla sugar add it to hot chocolate add it to your homemade bottle of vanilla extract etc The latter is what I did My homemade vanilla extract that I made last year for Christmas is getting low Soon I ll be adding even more vanilla beans and vodka to the bottle If using non dairy condensed milk this recipe will also be vegan Personally I d use full fat coconut milk when making my own dairy free condensed milk Original recipe by Shirley Braden Only spoon a few bites worth un petite peu if you will into a bowl See the amount in my grandmother s creamer in the top photo I love using non traditional sentimental dishes for small bowls of treats That amount is almost too much but once you ve spooned it into your serving dish you will eat it You just won t be able to help yourself I don t know if you ll agree that it tastes like creme brulee but I m pretty sure you ll find this ice cream to be tres bonne Other gfe ice cream recipes some made

       "  u'{title:Simply Perfect Pancakes guaranteed to please ,body:The perfect pancake Fact or fiction For such a simple dish flour milk salt butter eggs and leavening there are certainly a plethora of recipes out there And not just variations read blueberry chocolate chip but hundreds and hundreds of recipes for just plain pancakes And it seems no one is content with the recipe they have It s a big game of musical chairs out there Let s go round and round and round on Google and when the music stops grab a recipe any new recipe Maybe that s why our guaranteed Simply Perfect Pancakes is one of the top recipe landing pages on our online recipe site To mark today s launch of our newly redesigned site I decided to determine the recipe with the most customer hits that hadn t yet been blogged And this is it pancakes Simple everyday pancakes Maybe we never blogged it because we figure everyone knows how to make pancakes and already has a favorite recipe But given the number of people searching this site for pancake recipe well we must have figured wrong So here it is yet another pancake recipe But this one is for perfect pancakes Simply Perfect Pancakes And what s the secret to these particular pancakes The perfect balance of ingredients King Arthur Flour for body baking powder for rise eggs for structure butter for richness and milk to bring it all together Plus a certain secret ingredient Malted milk powder a richly flavored sweetener that gives these cakes a certain diner style je ne sais quoi Still hunting for the ultimate pancake recipe Well the music has stopped grab a chair and give this recipe a try Your long search may finally be over Put the following in a mixing bowl 2 large eggs1 1 4 cups milk Start with just 1 cup milk if you re baking under hot humid conditions or if you re going to let the batter rest longer than 15 minutes Use up to 1 1 4 cups milk in cold dry conditions What s the difference Depending on the amount of milk used the pancake batter will be thicker thinner and thus the cakes will be thicker thinner In summer or when it s stored in hot humid conditions flour acts like a sponge soaking up moisture from the atmosphere Thus you ll usually use less liquid in your recipes in summer more in winter And how about resting the batter The longer it rests the more it thickens as the flour gradually absorbs the liquid Bottom line If you prefer thicker pancakes go easy with the milk You can always thin the batter with more milk but it s hard to use less milk once you ve already added it Beat the eggs and milk until light and foamy about 3 minutes at high speed of a stand or hand mixer Whisk together the following 1 1 2 cups King Arthur Unbleached All Purpose Flour3 4 teaspoon salt2 teaspoons baking powder2 tablespoons sugar OR 1 4 cup malted milk powder Stir into the milk egg Don t beat some lumps are OK Add 3 tablespoons melted butter or vegetable oil Stir it in Note If you read our online recipe for these pancakes it tells you to add the melted butter oil to the milk egg prior to adding the dry ingredients I use melted butter rather than oil and when I add warm butter to cold milk egg it coagulates into little globules that in my opinion don t blend into the batter very nicely Thus I add the melted butter at the end when the room temperature flour has warmed the batter up a bit Notice how this batter drips off the spatula in a narrow stream it s pretty thin I m going to let it rest for at least 15 minutes while my griddle is heating it ll thicken slightly Even after a rest though the batter will be fairly thin and the pancakes I make will be on the thin side which is the way I like them Heat a heavy frying pan over medium heat or set an electric griddle to 375 F Lightly grease the frying pan or griddle The pan or griddle is ready if a drop of water skitters across the surface evaporating immediately Drop 1 4 cupfuls of batter onto the lightly greased griddle Cook on one side until bubbles begin to form and break about 2 minutes Then turn the pancakes and cook the other side until brown about 1 1 2 to 2 minutes Turn over only once lots of flipping will yield tough pancakes Serve immediately First comes the butter then the maple syrup I prefer Grade B maple syrup for the best most assertive flavor Look at that lovely interior Nice and light Anticipation Can t you just taste these warm buttery pancakes with their drizzle of sweet maple syrup The weekend s here bookmark this recipe on our new site and give it a try Then add your review we d love to hear what you think Want a hard copy right now Print the recipe Tags breakfast guaranteed pancakes This entry was posted on Friday August 12th 2011 at 9 00 pm and is filed under pancakes waffles view all You can follow any comments to this entry through the RSS 2 0 feed You can skip to the end and leave a comment Pinging is currently not allowed ,url:kingarthurflour blog 2011 08 12 simply perfect pancakes guaranteed to please}',\n",

       "  u'{title:Nutella chocolate mug cakes Kirbie s Cravings ,body:Wednesday March 30 2011 This cake is ridiculously easy to make and perfect for a quick chocolate nutella fix Chocolate mug cakes have been on my radar for over a year now The idea is pretty neat You combine all the ingredients in a large mug cook it in the microwave for a few minutes and out comes a steaming chocolate cake The clean up and prep time are both minimal I think start to finish the process took me less than 10 minutes Some call this the five minute mug cake but I think it s a little more than 5 minutes It may be five minutes if you have all the ingredients laid out but if they are scattered about it s more like a less than ten minute recipe Still ridiculously easy though I had read that some of these chocolate mug cakes are a little dry Then I saw a a recipe for nutella chocolate mug cakes on The Family Kitchen and knew I had to check it out since I love nutella recipes The cake came out perfect Not too dry and the nutella taste is very present The texture is just like a cake that is baked I couldn t tell that it was made in a microwave It took 1 1 2 minutes in the microwave and about 5 minutes of prep time So easy I made one initially with the recipe as is pictured above and even adorned it with whipped cream and a drizzle of chocolate but the cake was good on its own too Then I experimented with the recipe a tiny bit replacing oil with butter and adding some baking powder On my second attempt I split the batter into two mugs because on my initial one the cake had risen pretty high with one large mug and these two Paris mugs are much smaller I m definitely going to make these again adapted from The Family Kitchen Ingredients 4 tablespoons all purpose flour 4 tablespoons white granulated sugar 1 4 tsp baking powder 1 egg 3 tablespoons cocoa powder 2 1 2 tablespoons Nutella 3 tablespoons milk splash of vanilla extract 3 tablespoons melted butter Instructions Combine all ingredients in a large coffee mug Whisk well with a fork until smooth Microwave on high for 1 1 2 3 minutes You should try it at 1 1 2 minutes and then take it out to check to see if it is done If not continue to microwave in thirty second intervals Mine was done at 1 1 2 minutes You don t want to overcook it or it will become rubbery Posted by Kirbie on March 30 2011 this cake is ridiculously easy to make and perfect for a quick chocolate\\\\/nutella fix. chocolate mug cakes have been on my radar for over a year now. the,url:kirbiecravings 2011 03 nutella chocolate mug cakes html}',\n",

       "  u'{title:Une Gamine dans la Cuisine Jensen Ackles Bars ,body:Since I played around with the original recipe by adding various ingredients including a sauce I tried to come up with a compact Mini Cooper name for these bars that was also inclusive of all the components I couldn t think of anything Chewy brown butter brown sugar espresso snickerdoodle butterscotch sauce bars is too long winded And it sounds like something out of Willy Wonka s Chocolate Factory Gene Wilder style I was not a fan of the umpa lumpas I like the name I chose The title offers no clue as to what these bars are If you decide to serve them at a party instead of pouring more wine into barley touched glasses or rambling on about how infuriating Lost is this season or how you stepped barefoot into your cat s hairball when you got out of bed that morning and had to bunny hop on one leg to the bathroom you can break awkward silences and tensions over a fresh break up by explaining to people what the bars are made of and drenched with Or if you re feeling anti social because you felt obligated to have a party and obligations automatically sap out any desire to do anything write out the ingredients on a small note card and place it next to the bars Be sure that the card is pretty and that the hand writing is legible Beautiful writing on an elegant card will keep your guests from realizing that you really want them to leave especially the guy who looks like the lead singer from Flock of Seagulls so you can just close the curtains put your pajamas on curl up on the sofa with the cat that used up the last of the paper towels watch season 3 of Arrested Development on dvd and finish off that nearly empty bottle of wine that no one seems to be enjoying I think these are the best bars Ever And there isn t a zest of lemon or square of dark chocolate involved For as much as I love dark chocolate sometimes it s nice to take a break from it We appreciate each other more after a brief period of separation otherwise we just look at each other and think oh it s you again These bars are the perfect rebound after a hiatus from the chocolate They have that sublime brown sugar textured chewiness that almost makes them taste like half baked cookie dough The brown butter gives the bars a creamy nut flavoured back drop and since they re made with only brown sugar there is more than a hint of deep almost molasses like caramel notes The cinnamon just takes these bars to the edge of becoming a snickerdoodle I didn t use too much because I didn t want to spice out that amazing brown butter taste The espresso powder is barely noticeable I think I would add more of it the next time That molten butterscotch sauce is completely unnecessary I just wanted to make these bars a little bit dressier However Be warned that once you try the bars and sauce together you may no longer like the naked bars I like my caramel and butterscotch to be slightly salty so it s the perfect marriage of sweet and salt along with a mild punch of spice Honestly these are now my favourite bars so far Jensen Ackles Bars alias Brown butter brown sugar espresso snickerdoodle butterscotch sauce bars bars adapted from not without salt printer friendly Recipe Bar ingredients 1 1 4 cups 2 1 2 sticks of unsalted butter cut into about 6 pieces for easier melting2 1 4 cups of all purpose flour1 1 2 teaspoons of baking Powder2 teaspoons of salt1 1 4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon1 teaspoon of espresso powder I should have used 1 1 2 2 1 4 cups of firmly packed light brown sugar3 eggs slightly beaten1 teaspoon of vanilla extract1 2 teaspoon of almond extractingredients 1 4 cup half a stick of butter1 2 cup of packed light brown sugar1 2 cup of heavy cream1 2 teaspoons of kosher salt use more or less to suit your taste Method Bars Preheat the oven to 350F Butter spray a 9x13 inch baking pan Line the bottom with parchment paper and butter flour the parchment Or line the entire pan with tin foil have the foil go over the edges for easy removal grease and flour the foil In a medium heavy bottomed saucepan melt all the butter over low heat Once the butter is melted turn the heat up to medium and cook the butter until it turns golden brown and takes on a nutty fragrance Depending on how high the heat is this may take several minutes Stir the butter occasionally and keep an eye on the colour It will get a little bit foamy but keep cooking until it starts to clarify and then change to a golden brown Once it has browned remove it from the heat and let it rest for about 5 minutes In a medium bowl whisk together the flour baking powder salt cinnamon and espresso powder Set it aside In a separate larger bowl mix the butter and sugar together with a large wooden spoon or spatula the mixture will be grainy Add the eggs vanilla and almond Mix well Be sure the eggs have been well incorporated Add the flour mixture and stir until thoroughly combined Scraping down the sides of the bowl as you stir Pour the batter into the prepared pan It might be thick so you may have to spread it out with the spatula Bake for 30 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out slightly moist but with no crumbs If the edges start to brown too much remove the pan and cover just the edges with some tin foil Once they are done place the pan on a cooling rack and let it come to room temperature You can serve these alone or with the butterscotch sauce Butterscotch In a medium heavy bottomed saucepan melt the butter over low heat Add the sugar cream and salt Whisk until blended Bring the mixture to a slow easy boil Cook for about 5 10 minutes stirring occasionally It will eventually begin to thicken Once it does cook for about 2 more minutes Remove from heat As it cools the butterscotch will thicken You can pour it over the bars just before serving them or pour it on ahead of time this will result in a thicker almost frosting like sauce Enjoy

       "  u'{title:Bacon Part II Cooking Tests ,body:href http cookingforengineers com article php id 3 first Bacon Cooking Test October 2004 I knew that I would have to continue to test different ways to cook bacon I was so sure that a second article would follow that I named labeled that first article as Part I Over half a year later I ve finally gotten around to writing up my latest experiments with cooking bacon I look at three more techniques in this article using a fourth cooking method low heat pan frying as a control Microwaving with a Makin Bacon dish grilling and slow baking Method 1 Microwaving with a Makin Bacon dish There are many specialty dishes designed for microwaving bacon Some are simply plastic plates with grooves cut in them to catch grease This one the Makin Bacon dish about 10 elevates the bacon on poles As many as a eighteen strips of bacon according to the manufacturer can be cooked at a time on this apparatus although I think my bacon must be wider than their bacon because only a dozen of my strips would fit Since I was only going to be cooking a couple strips I used only the center pole Following the instructions on the Makin Bacon box I covered the bacon with a paper towel to reduce potential splatter I then microwaved it on high for 90 seconds The bacon at the top where it bends over the beam was thoroughly cooked almost overcooked However some of the fatty parts were still soft and partially unrendered The texture of the bacon was thick and crunchy similar to the microwaved bacon from the first test There was also a slight off flavor to the bacon indicative of heating the bacon to too high of a temperature It is definitely a very fast way to cook and with the Makin Bacon dish a reasonable number of pieces can be cooked at the same time As advertised the bacon grease dripped down into the plastic container The instructions recommend pouring out the bacon grease but why waste a good thing After the grease cools simply spoon it out into a storage container and store in the refrigerator The grease collected was fairly clean with some small pieces of bacon in it Method 2 Grilling I prepared a grill with low heat about 300 350 degrees and laid out the bacon onto the cooking surface Flipping the bacon every five minutes they reached doneness in twenty minutes time With this method the meaty portions were chewy but not overly so while the fat was light and crisp There were also no off flavors to the bacon Because of the texture and flavor this was Tina s favorite cooking method Because the bacon grease dripped down into the grill there was no grease to collect and save afterward there was also no clean up required Depending on the size of your grill you can cook a great deal of bacon at once Method 3 Baking at low temperatures I seemed to have lost the pictures that accompanied this baking technique but their not much to look at anyway it s just an oven I laid out strips of bacon onto a wire rack and positioned a wire rack on a foil lined half sheet pan I placed the pan in an oven preheated to 200 F 93 C and waited The theory was that the low heat would penetrate the bacon slowly and as the bacon cooked the fat would render but without increasing the bacon temperature to a level where the preserving agents of cured meat begin to react and form new compounds producing an off taste and potentially carcinogenic substances but more chemicals such as ascorbic acid or erythorbic acid are added these days to help mitigate these effects Unfortunately I do not know how long the bacon was in the oven because I forgot to look at the time and fell asleep My best estimate is that the bacon baked for about 3 hours The baking resulted in extremely straight pieces of bacon that I found to have exceptional taste and flavor as compared to the pan frying and grilling the microwaved bacon s off taste was really apparent next to the baked bacon The texture was crispy throughout Since flavor and texture were great this is my favorite cooking method Tina prefers a little chewier meat and still likes the grilled method the best The long cooking time means this method is best for cooking bacon in large quantities multiple pans and then bagging and refrigerating them for future use The bacon grease collected from the half sheet pan was pure white and completely devoid of charred bits Method 4 Pan frying As a control I cooked the bacon in the same way as the winning method from the first bacon test pan frying I placed three strips of bacon in a cold pan and placed it over low heat After fifteen minutes of cooking while turning the bacon occasionally the bacon was done The bacon was light and crispy with a little chewiness to the meat The grilled method s results came closest to this bacon The bacon grease remaining in the pan had a pale gray brown color and was spotted with charred bits and pieces of bacon Conclusions If you re in a rush microwaving works but for the best flavor and texture either grill or bake in advance If you own a propane grill cooking bacon over the grill is easier and more convenient than doing it on a stove top However if you don t mind spending the time baking produces the best results with pure bacon grease for use later may I suggest clam chowder cooking and taste tests: bacon (part ii) cooking,cooking tests,taste tests,bacon (part

pedo come here I m with marygorgeous it would also turn me away from the product The second pic looks OK safer mamaluvamen on Aug 02 2011 10 13 amI agree too that the first pic is inappropriately sexed up for someone her age High heels satin dress that appears to be suffering a wardrobe malfunction thank goodness for her necklace medallion animal print bedding and a come hither look in those baby eyes No way The second picture s not bad but as a mom I want these little folks to enjoy their childhood I m uneasy about any kid working when they are so young I know there are plenty of kids on TV and in the movies but there are so many that crash and burn later on Most of them would have been better off riding their bikes and going to the waterpark with their friends no the fashion pa10 years old is too young on Aug 02 2011 10 23 amFirst picture I find disturbing too She s too young to be all glammed up petting bunnies This ad is suppose to sell 30 year old women expensive clothing really You don t see the look from pic 1 on young girls unless they are a dancer figure skater etc The second photo is gorgeous But why is she in a bedroom yuck Can entertainment industries stop building Britney Spears saga type lifestyles tammykUmm she s only 10 on Aug 02 2011 11 19 amI agree with everyone else the first picture is kind of weird seeing her all glam up petting rabbits I wonder who the target audience for that ad will be But the second picture wow she s so pretty with those blue eyes I see why she s a model but I think it would be better if she was posing for something more appropriate like maybe petting rabbits at a zoo jskim07Is it bad to say I love it on Aug 02 2011 11 21 amI think she looks adorable and I was stuck on that blog for an hour The first picture I think was the most provocative but the ones made her look more like her age I would definitely follow her to see what she does when she s older but right now I think she s cute glamgalWow on Aug 02 2011 12 25 pmIn modeling you have to start young this girl is ahead of the game She looks really good though reminds me of toddlers in tiaras that show can be very strange sometimes alexjcMore photos on Aug 03 2011 06 52 pmHere are two more photos via thegloss comand I have to say these are way too over sexulaized I understand modeling but when it comes down to it she is a child and this is just plain icky I find the picture of her in denim especially unwholesome I think it is because if she had a more womanly figure this would be extremely sexual in terms of the clothing and the positioning of her body This crosses the line lehaThis is crazy on Aug 03 2011 08 12 pmNo wonder we have little girls asking do I look sexy This is the kind of message that the media is sending to them Modeling at that age is one thing if she s modeling for Gap Kids or the Sears Catalogue children s section But this is ridiculous What kind of parent allows their child to be portrayed in this kind of light It makes me angry erinleetoo much pressure on Aug 03 2011 08 35 pmIt kind of reminds me of a Toddlers and Tiaras type of thing or at least I d assume so I ve never actually been able to force myself to watch an entire episode of that IMO I think a 10 year old girl should be thinking about what most 10yr old girls think about dolls playing with their friends boys having cooties or developing their first crush P not how designer their clothes are or their weight to keep modeling etc Hearing about parents that put that kind of pressure on their children kind of sickens me its like they re asking for their kids to have self image issues as they get older My old neighbor had a 5 year old daughter and she dressed her in basically mini adult type of clothes she d have this attitude and say things that reminded me of a teenager almost She was such a sweet girl but so often it seemed like her mom was pushing her to grow up too fast Dead serious I was watching her one afternoon evening when her mom was out and I remember her telling me that she wouldn t eat McDonalds or other fast food places because she didn t want to get fat It was heartbreaking to see this little girl putting that kind of pressure on herself and I can t help but imagine that the girl in the pictures must have even more of that same type of pressure on herself Kids should be allowed to be kids not molded into little adults thread,fashion,10 year old fashion model i was on fashionista.com&nbsp;the other day and started reading an article about a new 10 year old model- thylane

durnin's d-drive the holy grail of infinitely variable transmissions?,body:Ready for a bit of a mental mechanical challenge Try your hand at understanding how the D Drive works Steve Durnin s ingenious new gearbox design is infinitely variable that is with your motor running at a constant speed the D Drive transmission can smoothly transition from top gear all the way through neutral and into reverse It doesn t need a clutch it doesn t use any friction drive components and the power is always transmitted through strong reliable gear teeth In fact it s a potential revolution in transmission technology it could be pretty much the holy grail of gearboxes if only it wasn t so diabolically hard to explain We flew to Australia s Gold Coast to take a close look at the D Drive and it looks to us like Durnin has pulled a rabbit out of his hat Check out the video after the jump and see if you can work out if there s a catch Geared transmissions a useful compromise In basic terms the idea of a gearbox is to create the ideal level of mechanical advantage between a motor and its output Motors of all kinds have a speed of maximum efficiency and a speed of maximum power and you use a gearbox to decide what engine speed you re running compared to the output speed In a car that means you want a low gear at low speeds or for quick acceleration because in lower gears the engine revs harder and produces more power Cruising on the freeway you want a high gear that lets you trundle along using the minimum practical engine RPM so you don t waste fuel So most gearboxes offer a compromise manual semi auto and auto transmissions offer you a set number of gears you can choose to find one that s close to the ideal ratio for what you re doing But there s efficiency losses in between gearshifts as you disengage the engine using a clutch or in the case of an auto a torque converter And although some geared transmissions offer lots of gear choices every set gear ratio is a compromise And the clutch itself is a fairly crude device when you re engaging a clutch you re basically pushing a set of plates together some of which are coated in high friction material which grab the other plates and force them to spin This approach is inefficient and prone to slip and wear under large power loads Variable transmissions very good but not quite Then there s Continuously Variable Transmissions or CVTs The CVT is in theory a much better solution because it allows a constant range of gear ratios between low and high gears Scooters use them as do some cars nowadays with a CVT the engine can sit at its most efficient or powerful RPM while the gear ratio constantly adjusts itself to match wheel speed But most CVTs have a limited range of ratios they can work through so while you can transition all the way from low gear up to high you can t go all the way down to neutral So they need to use a friction clutch or torque converter to get them started from a standstill and what s more in order to achieve variablilty in the gear ratio they re almost always built around some sort of friction drive too like belts pulling on conical rollers or rollers being mashed against toroid shapes All these friction components cause troubles when you start trying to put high power and torque through them they start to slip and fail they wear and generally contribute to inefficiencies in the drive train That s why you tend to go back to gears when you re designing a high powered machine Gear teeth are reliable the bigger the teeth the more power they can handle The D Drive infinitely variable no friction components If all this gearbox talk seems like a long setup it s kind of necessary to understand the problem when you re looking at the solution Steve Durnin has come up with Because at the heart of it what Steve has managed to do is create a gearbox that requires no clutch at all is infinitely variable from top gear through neutral and even into reverse and doesn t use ANY clutches or friction drive components instead the power is ALWAYS transmitted from input to output through gear teeth But how on Earth do you obtain infinite variability using gears After all a cog s a cog it s not like you can make them magically grow and shrink in size The answer is that you ve got to stop thinking about gear sizes or cones and belts or any familiar transmission picture you have in your head when you re talking about the D Drive Because when you look at it the only way to tell what sort of ratio it s in at a given moment is to look at the two spinning shafts in the middle of it If the bottom shaft is still and the top one s turning you re in top gear If the top shaft is still and the bottom one s turning you re in reverse If the top and bottom shafts are spinning at the same speed but in opposite directions you re in neutral And you can speed up or slow down those shafts as much as you like to vary the gear ratio to any point between full speed reverse and full speed forward You really have to watch the attached video to start to understand how this gearbox works but in essence it s built around planetary gear systems at either side with sun gears planet gears and revolving ring gears all interacting with one another The energy efficiency equation In order to control the spinning speeds of the upper and lower shafts you have to input a certain amount of energy for instance to put the D Drive transmission into neutral you have to spin the bottom shaft around at a speed that equals the speed of the driven top shaft But according to Steve and his engineers calculations the energy you put in to do spin that bottom shaft is only a tiny fraction of the energy your main engine is running All that energy has to do is to spin the planetary gears around one another in such a way as to effect the final ratio And you can do that in a number of ways Steve s current demo prototype uses electric engines both as the input engine and to spin the control shafts as needed But taking the example of using the D Drive in a car you could easily use an auxiliary electric motor to control the gear ratios or a kinetic energy recovery system or some sort of regenerative braking system You could even harvest energy directly from the driven shaft and use it to spin the control shaft Steve s prototype is only sufficient for demonstration purposes and you d have to question how effective a demonstration it is when just about everyone that looks at the thing is left scratching their heads and wondering er so how exactly does that thing work again The next step building a test rig Durnin is currently in the process of raising funds to build a test rig a strong metallic rendition of the D Drive with the ability to measure how much energy is going in at the input end what s coming out at the other end and how much power is being put into the control shafts but he and the engineers he s consulted are confident that the D Drive will be proven to be an order of magnitude more efficient than existing gearboxes The implications are pretty huge if he s right and the numbers come up looking good as a geared system the D Drive is scalable in the extreme and could remove the need for friction components or manual gearboxes in everything from cars motorcycles trucks industrial and farm equipment massive marine applications wind power generators basically anything that s got an engine Because it s all gears and bearings reliability should be excellent and servicing or repairing the D Drive a snap Because you just need to spin or lock those control shafts to come up with your final ratio you could use anything from a fully computerized smart control system to a manually applied pin through the control shaft to change your gear ratios making it useful in certain very low tech situations as well as extremely tunable in an automatic automotive application About the inventor Steve Durnin is a plumbing inspector from Queensland Australia who has been tinkering with the D Drive and several other ideas for more than 20 years The D in D Drive incidentally stands for Durnin This is the first invention that Steve has tried to patent and commercialize so while the D Drive looks very promising it s taking him some time to push through the relevant channels His demonstration prototype and patents were paid for by a small group of private investors who stand to gain a heck of a lot if the D Drive cranks out the right numbers on a test dyno and breaks into the market We thank Steve for his time and wish him all the best with the D Drive It s a diabolically hard invention to understand even when you re looking at the prototype in action so he s one clever cookie to be able to come up with the concept from scratch particularly seeing as he claims he had never heard of a planetary gear system before he d designed one as part of the D Drive Quite an achievement Steve can be contacted through his very embryonic website For an update on the D Drive and the reaction it has sparked click here ready for a bit of a mental mechanical challenge? try your hand at understanding how the

       "  u\"{title:Week 1 Judgements Eagles bring old sloppy ways into new season NFL week 1 judgements: eagles bring old sloppy ways into new season,body:By Clark Judge Senior NFL Columnist Sep 10 2012 12 13 AM ET 1 Admit it Philadelphia got lucky The Eagles couldn t have beaten anyone but Cleveland playing as they did Sunday and they better clean up their act presto Turnovers killed them last year they had 38 and turnovers should ve killed them again Sunday They had five and nearly a sixth before Michael Vick recovered his own fumble and sorry Cleveland but officials got the call right 2 Guess that quiets the Tebow Jets critics for a couple of days OK maybe it quiets them for a couple of hours 3 One of these days Pittsburgh will keep Denver s Demaryius Thomas from gashing its secondary Just don t ask me which one 4 Maybe Rex Ryan is right when he says he s a great coach All I know is he didn t just beat an opponent some ticketed for the playoffs he pulverized it We knew what we were capable of said wide receiver Jeremy Kerley We just showed the world If that s sounds like boasting it should The Jets earned it 5 I don t know what happened to New Orleans either but Drew Brees demands an explanation 6 Just my opinion but Ryan Longwell couldn t have made that game tying 55 yard field goal with no time left in the fourth quarter 7 Yep Mike Shanahan and the Redskins look like geniuses but keep this in mind Shanahan s teams have a history of starting fast and wind down down as they finish He won his last four season openers prior to Sunday and didn t finish with a winning record in any of those seasons 8 Relax Chiefs fans Your club surrendered 41 in its season opener at Arrowhead last year and almost recovered without Jamaal Charles 9 Best move of the weekend was by the Modell family sparing the Cleveland Browns a difficult decision by asking them not to honor Art Modell The Browns did what they should which was agree to have a moment of silence for the former owner but fans weren t going to be so compliant and the Modells knew it So they cut the Browns a break and asked them not to hold the ceremony which took everyone off the hook 10 I told you Colt McCoy wasn t the problem in Cleveland These guys can t find the end zone with a diving rod They needed playmakers not another quarterback So they start Brandon Weeden and he throws four picks Don t say you weren t warned 11 That s 12 interceptions for Ryan Fitzpatrick in his last five starts four of which Buffalo lost and the question must be asked Did the Bills sink millions in the wrong quarterback They believed in Fitzpatrick so much they passed on Andy Dalton in the 2011 draft and that doesn t look like such a smart move now Oh and just in case you re wondering Buffalo lost its last eight when Fitzpatrick throws two or more interceptions in a game 12 The worst call of the weekend had nothing to do with replacements refs It was in the Orioles Yanks game and it was first base ump Jerry Meals with the blinders on again It s time for baseball to wake up to what the NFL did years ago expanded instant replay Either that or send Meals to the next team of replacement refs 13 The New York Jets scored more points on Sunday 48 than they did in the entire preseason 31 Just another reason NOT to pay attention to what happens in preseason 14 So Andrew Luck lost his career opener Big deal So did Peyton Manning in 1998 As a matter of fact so did the last seven quarterbacks chosen with the first pick of the NFL Draft The last one to win was David Carr in 2002 15 Get used to it Chicago Jay Cutler threw to Brandon Marshall 15 times Sunday completing nine He threw no more than six times to anyone else and yeah I make Marshall an early favorite to lead the league in catches 16 No quarterback in NFL history made it to 125 wins faster than Tom Brady who got there with Sunday s defeat of Tennessee Brady is 125 35 in regular season starts the best winning percentage of any quarterback in the Super Bowl era with at least 100 starts Just another reason he s the best quarterback of his generation 17 Yes the Broncos escaped Pittsburgh and yes Peyton Manning looks like himself again Now the fine print Five of Denver s next seven games are against playoff teams starting with Atlanta next weekend and Houston after that 18 The more I see David Akers kick for San Francisco the more I wonder why the Eagles let him go Not only doesn t he miss he just tied a league record with a 63 yard field goal Honestly he said it s a little bit of a miracle Hey whatever works 19 ESPN on Sunday asked if there will be a hangover with this year s Green Bay Packers Somebody cue Jim Mora Hangover Hangover The Packers lost their only playoff game last year That question must ve been left over from the 2011 season opening script 20 Got to hand it to Mike Tice The Bears offensive coordinator opened with a flourish piling up 428 yards in his debut the fifth highest total for Chicago under Lovie Smith Those are numbers you expect from Mike Martz not Mad Mike Tice FIVE THINGS I LIKE 1 Kevin Kolb to the rescue The Cardinals invested heavily in the guy paying him a 7 million roster bonus in March that kept them from pursuing Peyton Manning So they believed in him and he let them down in training camp But he didn t Sunday coming off the bench to throw the winning touchdown pass and look like the quarterback they thought they were getting when they acquired him from Philadelphia Good for Kevin Kolb It s time he catches a break 2 Randy Moss vs Green Bay The guy s played 15 career games against the Packers with 14 touchdowns He was wide open for Sunday s score and yeah I think it s not a bad idea to cover him 3 New England s schedule Between now and Dec 10 the Patriots face one opponent Baltimore in two weeks with a winning record in 2011 4 Washington at the Superdome The Redskins are now 7 1 there 5 Green Bay s Randall Cobb in season openers He had a 108 yard kickoff return for a touchdown in 2011 and a 75 yard punt return for a score Sunday FIVE THINGS I DON T 1 Dick LeBeau vs Peyton Manning LeBeau is one of the best defensive coordinators ever but not against Manning With Sunday s loss he s 1 7 vs Peyton 2 Philadelphia s ball security What ball security The Eagles had five turnovers and nearly a sixth That was an area they were supposed to clean up but they had turnovers on three of four consecutive second half series 3 Officials calling no penalty on Cobb s 75 yard punt return There was a flag thrown but officials later said there was no foul Uh correction yes there was Terrell Manning clearly hit Anthony Dixon from behind which is as officials first noticed an infraction My question Why did the official who threw the flag change his mind I ll let you guys write that story said 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh I had a good look at that play but I don t know what I m supposed to say and not supposed to say 4 Green Bay s running game What running game The 49ers dropped a lot of guys into coverage daring Green Bay to beat them with the run and the Packers tried But they failed with Rodgers their leading rusher Cedric Benson had 18 yards and the club had 45 Ryan Grant where are you 5 Receivers calling for flags with each incompletion This trend is worse than soccer players bellyflopping Enough is enough guys Let officials do their jobs and you do yours FIVE GUYS WHO HAVE SOME SPLAINING TO DO 1 Cleveland coach Pat Shurmur Why after two seasons is your offense still stuck in neutral The Browns fired Eric Mangini because they wanted more fireworks on offense and I get that But Shurmur s teams have been so underwhelming they make Mangini s teams look like the 1989 Niners especially at home where they have exactly one offensive touchdown in their last 14 quarters 2 Carolina quarterback Cam Newton He s supposed to be better than he was a year ago when he was the league s Offensive Rookie of the Year And maybe he will be But he wasn t all that effective against a Tampa Bay team he was supposed to beat and this just in That s not how icons are made Cam 3 Minnesota defensive coordinator Alan Williams Earlier this summer Williams said he believed his unit could be a top 10 defense and he might be right but not if he keeps hanging out his defensive backs I mean what in the world were you doing Alan leaving Chris Cook in single coverage at the end of the fourth quarter It nearly cost you a ballgame 4 New Orleans interim coach for interim coach Aaron Kromer One question What happened to that flawless transition 5 Referee Bruce Hermansen Sooner or later replacement refs were going to screw up and Hermansen s crew did It gave Seattle a fourth time out that could ve jobbed Arizona Fortunately for Arizona it didn t and Hermansen later accepted blame for blowing the call THE FAD FIVE It seems as if virtually everyone but Denver is starting a young quarterback There were nine starters this weekend with no more than two years experience in the NFL including five rookies It s the first time there have been that many freshmen quarterbacks to open the season and let s see how they played

and feel healthier you ve come to the right place Subscribe to my free weekly newsletter for tips advice and special insider only information Learn more about the Primal Lifestyle by visiting the Primal Blueprint 101 page Thanks for visiting This week s Tuesday Ten features simple tips to make your brain hum You ll feel so great you ll be looking down on Cloud 9 Before we get to it a word to the wise about serotonin There is quite the plethora of mood elevating serotonin enhancing products and drugs available If you don t want to go the Prozac route there are many excellent natural methods for boosting your mood Indeed many studies have shown that natural methods like exercise may be just as effective as traditional drug therapies However in some cases depression can become so severe there s simply no food or supplement that is going to cure you I like to remind my readers that it s always important to consult an expert before embarking on your own curative adventure But for light cases of the blues or stressful days there are plenty of things you can do to elevate that feel good hormone serotonin 10 Avoid the fast track to happiness Carbohydrates give you an instant lift because they trigger the release of serotonin Indeed I ve seen several articles lately actually recommend eating a sugary treat to boost your mood and sleep better Bad advice see Dr Weil s take Carbs are a quick fix but they do nothing to stimulate ongoing production of serotonin which is what you want 9 Don t avoid carbs entirely Proteins contain tryptophan a large amino that converts to serotonin in the brain I ll be discussing tryptophan supplements in the future Yet relying solely on protein can hamper serotonin production Though scientists aren t sure why this is it makes sense that subsisting entirely on one macro nutrient might cause problems for brain chemistry Tryptophan works best when consumed in conjunction with a small bit of carbohydrate such as a scoop of brown rice a handful of nuts or a few tablespoons of legumes These complex carbohydrates are essential to helping your brain properly process the tryptophan in protein Vegetables are also great and my preference 8 Eat protein Turkey fish chicken cottage cheese nuts cheese eggs and beans all contain generous levels of tryptophan 7 Eat fat Hormonal processes require essential fatty acids so don t shirk your good fats Get plenty of DHA enhanced eggs and dairy in your diet and eat fish a few times a week Good sources are wild salmon mackerel and tuna You vegheads can also nosh on avocados nuts flaxseed vegetable oils walnut avocado almond flax olive and seeds 6 Take a fish oil supplement Though fish oil won t produce serotonin essential fatty acids play a vital role in brain health and mood regulation I recommend Vital Omegas of course but there are plenty of good ones on the market As with most things you do get what you pay for so buy the best you can afford 5 Exercise to feel good Exercise is a natural stimulator of many important mood hormones including serotonin and dopamine Don t think of exercise as a chore to lose weight or prevent heart disease someday Realize that 15 or 20 minutes of exercise every day will naturally release these feel good hormones that are so vital to feeling happy and calm As junior apple Mike A says exercise is about feeling good not just looking good 4 Avoid the stimulant cycle Caffeine sugar alcohol Caffeine sugar alcohol Many of us get trapped in the stimulant cycle These substances temporarily give you a lift but actually deplete and blunt valuable hormones in the long run If you like caffeine try to limit your java intake to one or two cups a day at the most The same for alcohol I recommend avoiding sugar completely 3 Sleep right When we re feeling down it s tempting to sleep sleep and sleep some more But quality sleep is far more important than quantity Force yourself to get up early but allow for a rejuvenating nap midday if you need it just don t exceed one hour The same goes for stressed out workaholics getting by on 5 or 6 hours of sleep a night Find a way to get an extra hour hey that sounds like another Tuesday 10 to me 2 Investigate supplements wisely HTP is a popular supplement but I personally prefer rhodiola which actually slows the process of serotonin breakdown it also has better scientific backing 1 Boost other hormones Oxytocin is another feel good hormone often called the cuddle hormone Oxytocin is released when we feel love trust and comfort It can be even more powerful than serotonin If you need a lift remember the power of simply spending time with your significant other or family members and friends Sponsor note This post was brought to you by the Damage Control Master Formula independently

Almaden Research Center campus in San Jose California Photographer Tony Avelar Bloomberg Buildings stand at the International Business Machines Corp IBM Almaden Research Center campus in the Santa Teresa Hills of San Jose California Photographer Tony Avelar Bloomberg By 2015 your mobile phone will project a 3 D image of anyone who calls and your laptop will be powered by kinetic energy At least that s what International Business Machines Corp sees in its crystal ball The predictions are part of an annual tradition for the Armonk New York based company which surveys its 3 000 researchers to find five ideas expected to take root in the next five years IBM the world s largest provider of computer services looks to Silicon Valley for input gleaning many ideas from its Almaden research center in San Jose California Holographic conversations projected from mobile phones lead this year s list The predictions also include air breathing batteries computer programs that can tell when and where traffic jams will take place environmental information generated by sensors in cars and phones and cities powered by the heat thrown off by computer servers These are all stretch goals and that s good said Paul Saffo managing director of foresight at the investment advisory firm Discern in San Francisco In an era when pessimism is the new black a little dose of technological optimism is not a bad thing For IBM it s not just idle speculation The company is one of the few big corporations investing in long range research projects and it counts on innovation to fuel growth Saffo said Not all of its predictions pan out though IBM was overly optimistic about the spread of speech technology for instance When the ideas do lead to products they can have broad implications for society as well as IBM s bottom line he said Research Spending They have continued to do research when all the other grand research organizations are gone said Saffo who is also a consulting associate professor at Stanford University IBM invested 5 8 billion in research and development last year 6 1 percent of revenue While that s down from about 10 percent in the early 1990s the company spends a bigger share on research than its computing rivals Hewlett Packard Co the top maker of personal computers spent 2 4 percent last year At Almaden scientists work on projects that don t always fit in with IBM s computer business The lab s research includes efforts to develop an electric car battery that runs 500 miles on one charge a filtration system for desalination and a program that shows changes in geographic data IBM rose 9 cents to 146 04 at 11 02 a m in New York Stock Exchange composite trading The stock had gained 11 percent this year before today Citizen Science The list is meant to give a window into the company s innovation engine said Josephine Cheng a vice president at IBM s Almaden lab All this demonstrates a real culture of innovation at IBM and willingness to devote itself to solving some of the world s biggest problems she said Many of the predictions are based on projects that IBM has in the works One of this year s ideas that sensors in cars wallets and personal devices will give scientists better data about the environment is an expansion of the company s citizen science initiative Earlier this year IBM teamed up with the California State Water Resources Control Board and the City of San Jose Environmental Services to help gather information about waterways Researchers from Almaden created an application that lets smartphone users snap photos of streams and creeks and report back on conditions The hope is that these casual observations will help local and state officials who don t have the resources to do the work themselves Traffic Predictors IBM also sees data helping shorten commutes in the next five years Computer programs will use algorithms and real time traffic information to predict which roads will have backups and how to avoid getting stuck Batteries may last 10 times longer in 2015 than today IBM says Rather than using the current lithium ion technology new models could rely on energy dense metals that only need to interact with the air to recharge Some electronic devices might ditch batteries altogether and use something similar to kinetic wristwatches which only need to be shaken to generate a charge The final prediction involves recycling the heat generated by computers and data centers Almost half of the power used by data centers is currently spent keeping the computers cool IBM scientists say it would be better to harness that heat to warm houses and offices In IBM s first list of predictions compiled at the end of 2006 researchers said instantaneous speech translation would become the norm That hasn t happened yet While some programs can quickly translate electronic documents and instant messages and other apps can perform limited speech translation there s nothing widely available that acts like the universal translator in Star Trek Second Life The company also predicted that online immersive environments such as Second Life would become more widespread While immersive video games are as popular as ever Second Life s growth has slowed Internet users are flocking instead to the more 2 D environments of Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc Meanwhile a 2007 prediction that mobile phones will act as a wallet ticket broker concierge bank and shopping assistant is coming true thanks to the explosion of smartphone applications Consumers can pay bills through their banking apps buy movie tickets and get instant feedback on potential purchases all with a few taps on their phones The nice thing about the list is that it provokes thought Saffo said If everything came true they wouldn t be doing their job To contact the reporter on this story Ryan Flinn in San Francisco at rflinn bloomberg net To contact the editor responsible for this story Tom Giles at tgiles5 bloomberg net by 2015, your
